I disclosed my most fondest Christmas wish list item to my lady friend last night — a [FiiO DM13 portable CD player](https://www.fiio.com/dm13). She laughed at me. *You want a discman for Christmas?* 

How can I explain my love of single-purpose devices and high-fidelity to someone who lives on their iPad and sees no problem with lossy streaming music? I want something that doesn't have a screen with which to focus on music and, for goodness’ sake, some time to part with my phone during the day. 

Bluetooth codecs have progressed, but Apple hasn't seen that as a priority in their annual device updates.[^1] Their hardware can't even output the high-fidelity audio that you can stream from their Apple Music service. One could probably successfully argue that Apple is more of a mass-consumer device manufacturer now than the company who used to cater to creatives.  

[^1]:	Or even in their headphone updates.
