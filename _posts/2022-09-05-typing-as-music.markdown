In [a piece for the New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-obsessive-pleasures-of-mechanical-keyboard-tinkerers), David Owen writes about the world of mechanical keyboard enthusiasts in the context of his own history and love of keyboards.

> Typing is rhythmic, complicated, and soothing, and, when I’m doing it well, my conscious brain doesn’t seem to be involved. It’s as close as I’ll ever come to playing a musical instrument—a nontrivial attraction. My love of typing probably contributed to my decision to become a writer.

As someone who was happy with the chiclet keys on the Apple keyboard, I didn't think I'd ever go with a mechanical unit. After getting one, though, I can understand the cult fandom around these things — at least a bit. I'll never pay thousands of dollars for a set of key caps. I do enjoy typing on this thing, though, and that allows me to write more. As a school-trained touch typist, I can also type faster with my Keychron. The Magic Keyboard feels a bit strange to my fingertips now.

I took a brother typewriter to college with me. It feels good to bring back some of those typing sensations without having to worry about how difficult it is to correct mistakes.
