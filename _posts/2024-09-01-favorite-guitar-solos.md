For a while, the guitar solo was laying low. In my formative years, it made few appearances, perhaps deemed too ostentatious by the indie rockers in the late 80s and 90s after taking some of the values of punk and hardcore forward. My brother told me a few years ago that Metallica had stopped playing the solos in their earlier songs live (a fact I have not been able to verify). 

Despite what the punk purists may say, I have always loved a good solo. My favorites run the gamut from those that are spare and economical (numbers 1 and 2) to blistering and raw (number 3) to drawn out, vacillating and expressive (numbers 4 and 5).  

1. Blondie - “One Way Or Another”
2. The Smiths - “Shoplifters of the World Unite”
3. Dinosaur Jr. - “Raisans”
4. Wilco - “Impossible Germany”
5. My Morning Jacket - “Lay Low”
