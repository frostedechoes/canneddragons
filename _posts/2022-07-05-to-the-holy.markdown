The church that I have been attending, [All Saints Orthodox Church](https://www.allsaintsnc.org/) has a new website design and a video to go along with it. The video is a meditation on what worship is like for an Orthodox Christian, focusing on the five senses. I appreciate the fact that it brings up the conditioning of the smells, sounds and sights that are involved with worship. I have come to associate the incense used at Divine Liturgy with the very act of worship.

> May my prayer be set before you like incense; may the lifting up of my hands be like the evening sacrifice. (Psalm 141:2)

Of course, that the soundtrack is a an ambient track in the vein of Hammock endears me all the more to this depiction of worship in an ancient tradition.
