I was reading my friend Adam's newsletter, [Tendrils](https://world.hey.com/adamwood/tendrils-017-just-because-something-looks-ugly-doesn-t-mean-that-it-s-morally-wrong-75b1eb7d), and I came upon some quick thoughts about the movie _mid90s_ in a collection of mini-reviews of [A24 movies](https://letterboxd.com/zioibi/list/a24/). While Adam enjoyed the movie because it brought back some skateboarding nostalgia, I hated it for much the same reason. It seems like every recent movie or documentary dealing with skateboarding, from _mid90s_ to _Minding the Gap_, makes it seem like skateboarders are a bunch of lawless teenage punks who have trouble with school or work. I was big into skateboarding in the early 90s, and I didn't find the stereotype to be true. Some of my friends from that era became software development managers, architects, and worked at major record labels. I would rather not make it sound like a career is the only measurement of success, but these guys clearly didn't meet the stereotype you see of skateboarders in the media.

Just like more organized sports, I think skateboarding can be a great outlet, provided the skaters have a safe environment in which to practice. The kids on an Arizona Hopi reservation [just got that](https://www.npr.org/2022/08/30/1119578688/skate-park-hopi-native-american-reservation) in the form of a skatepark. One of the co-leads on the project, Quintin Nahsonhoya, talks about the positive effect of having a place designated and designed for skateboarding.

> "Skateboarders aren't like how they're perceived in movies, as punks or like people who just want to get into trouble," he said. "It's just a hobby that we haveâ€¦ and the community understood that."

I'm glad to see more and more instances of towns and cities recognizing the potential of skateparks to channel kids' energy. I only wish that sort of mentality had been around when I was younger.
