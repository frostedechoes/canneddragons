I realize that I posted a video from Colatura not long ago, but the second single off of their debut is as winsome as the first and it seemed like an opportunity wasted not to share it.

"Some days, crowded spaces feel lonely, some days they feel okay." It may not be the most profound lyric ever written, but it carries with it some truth that all of us have felt.
