Last week, I wrote about some musical favorites from 2021. This week, I'm posting the video from one of my favorite songs that isn't from last year, but that I _discovered_ last year. I think this one surfaced due to the Apple Music recommendation algorithm, which has gotten really good. I ask Siri to play a song on the diminutive but fairly powerful HomePod Mini, then, once the song is done, the device magically plays other music that I like. The hit to miss ratio is high these days, and I'm finding out about a lot of bands that sound similar to the ones I already enjoy. Since several music blogs that I used to follow have now become celebrity gossip sites (ahem, Stereogum, cough, Consequence), I need a sonic buddy in the form of a solid recommendation engine.

Geowulf's "Saltwater" sticks in my brain and produces a sort of wistfulness that's simultaneously sad and comforting. It evokes memories of trips to the beach, which have spanned the entirety of my life, and leaves me with a longing for another walk on the sand to sort through my thoughts. The image of letting saltwater wash over you "even when you're broken," speaks to me physically and emotionally.
