The election is, whether mercifully or unmercifully, in the rearview mirror. Like [some others](https://bearblog.jasonkratz.me/working-towards-better-mental-health-choices/), I want to turn my attention away from the day’s news, so closely coupled as it is with political events. Before I read about Kid Rock being appointed ambassador to the U.N., I mean to spend some time with my head in books. 

[Standard Ebooks](https://standardebooks.org) has inspired me by making the barrier to reading well-produced classics low and ebooks free to obtain. From the site:

> Standard Ebooks takes ebooks from sources like Project Gutenberg, formats and typesets them using a carefully designed and professional-grade style manual, fully proofreads and corrects them, and then builds them to create a new edition that takes advantage of state-of-the-art ereader and browser technology.

This week I downloaded a collection from Emerson (which includes *Self Reliance*) and *The Imitation of Christ* by Thomas à Kempis. I haven’t started on Emerson yet, but I’ve found much enrichment in the latter book. Its short, focused chapters are a sort of balm in times when the world feels abrasive.

In the pages of this 500-year-old book, you will find the very things that speak to the rancor and division of contemporary American society.

> True it is that every man willingly followeth his own bent, and is the more inclined to those who agree with him. But if Christ is amongst us, then it is necessary that we sometimes yield up our own opinion for the sake of peace. Who is so wise as to have perfect knowledge of all things? Therefore trust not too much to thine own opinion, but be ready also to hear the opinions of others. Though thine own opinion be good, yet if for the love of God thou foregoest it, and followest that of another, thou shalt the more profit thereby.

I’m praying that I can read these words with fresh eyes. It's easy to absorb the words at night, though, and much harder to go out into the following day and put them into practice.
