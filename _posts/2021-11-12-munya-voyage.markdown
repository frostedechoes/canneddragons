A few weeks ago, [I blogged about]( __GHOST_URL__ /2021/10/12/munya-voyage-to.html) Quebec artist MUNYA and her upcoming album, _Voyage to Mars_. MUNYA just released a new track off the album, the disco-inflected “Voyage” and filmed a video to go with it. In the video, lots of construction is going on, but the viewer is never really given a total picture of what is being built. It’s almost as if she’s creating something that can never be completed. The lyrics repeated over and over in the chorus may speak something to this.

> All my life, all the dreams  
> I’ll never forget about you.

In the place of completion, there’s a sense of loss. Accompanying that sense of loss is the drive to move on. Perhaps a resignation over a relationship that’s never going to work out.
