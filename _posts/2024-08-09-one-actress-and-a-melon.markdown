The creative forces behind Ginger Root have a concept for a show featuring one actress (it's all they had the budget for). Their Japanese protagonist changes looks and activities often to keep people of the world glued to their sets. In the end, it seems, what suits her best is rockin' out.

The song "There Was A Time" itself has a breezy 70s feel, with a healthy dose of tropicalia in the mix and a smidgen of psychedelia. There is a warped cassette haze on the whole track that wouldn't sound out of place in the heyday of chillwave a little over a decade ago (this could be due to the Toro Y Moi influence). Ginger Root's mastermind, Cameron Lew, describes the project as "aggressive elevator soul." "There Was A Time" is a fun listen and matches the rest of the currently available tracks from the upcoming *Shinbangumi* in style.
