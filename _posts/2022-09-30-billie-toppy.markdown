Men I Trust return with a new single to accompany their tour of the states. This one surprised me by beginning with a Factory Records sound and progressing into a chugging, propulsive post-punk ripper. A new wave guitar line comes up about a minute and a half into the track. Keyboard flourishes show up later on to add a bit more to the era-specific sounds. The video features lead singer Emma Proulx swinging in front of an intentionally crummy video backdrop with some haunting vibes.

With the exception of the vocals, this hardly seems like the same band that put out the breezy, danceable _Oncle Jazz_ record a few short years ago. I'm not sure if this is a one-off or whether Men I Trust has a new sound, but I'm here for it. This is easily one of my favorite tracks that they have recorded. I wish I didn't have to drive to the mountains to see them on tour because I would love to catch this song live.
