Sometimes Apple Music inspires me by algorithmically playing fitting sequential songs after a self-made playlist. This happened recently when I had been listening to some tracks I had stuck together and it followed them up with a Chromeo and then a Cut Copy song. I never would have thought to put the two together, but the combo worked really well. I could imagine myself DJ’ing — spinning those tracks back to back to get people moving. That was the inspiration for this playlist, [Dance Music For Introverts](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/dance-music-for-introverts/pl.u-jV89DmJIVYDE4). It's a bit of a misnomer, since some of it is just straight up dance music, but it works.

I continue to be amazed by how tightly Apple Music has been tuned since it first debuted. Obviously, whenever you are dealing with machine learning, the more data you have, the better the recommendation engine can be. In this case, after listening to the first few songs I added to the playlist, I was literally thinking, "I need to put Toro Y Moi’s 'New Beat' on here." Before I could even do that, Apple Music played the song when the playlist had ended.

_That's entertainment_.
