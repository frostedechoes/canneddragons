Jane Penny, the frontwoman for TOPS is following in the footsteps of her bandmate Marta Cikojevic (aka [Marci](https://marciii.bandcamp.com/track/stop)) and releasing a solo EP. The song features the satiny smooth vocals we’ve come to expect from Ms. Penny. I can’t confirm, but I would assume the music was composed by long-time collaborator David Carriere. There are sleek, modern sensibilities throughout the track that mix with a style that is in some ways congruent with decades old pop radio. This one will make for some pleasant repeat listens.

The new 7-song EP, *Surfacing*, will be out April 5, 2024 on Luminelle records (which I believe is in some way affiliated with *Gorilla Vs. Bear*)
