I will start by showing my cards here and admitting that I can’t wait to see _Andor_, the latest of the Star Wars shows to premiere on Disney+. The only reason I haven’t already dipped back into the _Star Wars_ universe is that my imagination is currently in Middle Earth, where the harfoots are undertaking a perilous journey and Sauron and his juicy, sunscreen-hoarding orcs are on the move. If I weren’t so deep into the story that _Rings of Power_ is weaving, I would have settled down in front of the big screen with the lights off and watched for that familiar _Star Wars_ logo that has brought joy to me since I was a kid. I’ve been waiting for a while for _Andor_ to come out and I have greater expectations for this show than any of the previous _Star Wars_ episodic TV shows (although I ended up enjoying them all).

The main reason that I’ve got such high hopes for _Andor_ is that I loved the movie _Rogue One_, on which it is based. I enjoyed Rogue One so much that I read the prequel, _Catalyst_ (which was the best _Star Wars_ novel I’ve read). While _Catalyst_ as a prequel focuses on the earlier history of the character Galen Erso and his friend who became his enemy, Orson Krennic, _Andor_ focuses on the titular character of Cassian Andor. In _Rogue One_, it was hinted at several times that Andor had an eventful and adventurous backstory. Now audiences get to find out exactly how adventurous that backstory was and what events shaped Andor’s character.

For me, modern _Star Wars_ movies peaked with _Rogue One_. Not longer after it debuted, we’ve now come to expect more television-style shows from the franchise than actual films. Moviegoing and television watching are completely different experiences. I remember vividly going to view the newer movies at _Cinebistro_, one of those theaters where you are served dinner before reclining in a luxurious oversized chair to watch the film you came to see. We would go as a development team from work and take up a few rows of the theater. I would always get the richest chocolate lava cake you can ever conceive of and deal with the stomach ache to go with it later. I loved seeing the movies as a group and then gathering around in the lobby later to discuss the merits of the films. We introduced more than one _Star Wars_ newbie to the franchise that way, giving them homework of seeing the original trilogy.

_Rogue One_, a story of how the resistance against the Galactic Empire won its first victory, hit at a time when resistance seemed like a real thing that was brewing. Donald Trump had just been elected president, and already there were concerns about his ties with Russia and potential criminality. As I drove home from the theater, I heard then president Obama speaking about the allegations. “Resist” became a slogan, and the sci-fi story of the resistance that became a rebellion seemed timely and frankly, somewhat inspirational. Opposing a tyrannical government no longer seemed so abstract to those in America.

In a [post for The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/20/23353104/andor-star-wars-review-disney-plus), Charles Pulliam-Moore summarizes _Andor_ by way of describing how its preceding film set the stage.

> Rogue One, director Gareth Edwards’ harrowing, shell-shocked, but ultimately optimistic story about the small group of freedom fighters who won the Rebel Alliance’s first victory against the Galactic Empire, was unlike any other Star Wars story when it debuted in 2016. As part of a franchise that — at the time — felt increasingly incapable of escaping the gravitational pull of its nostalgia-logged core mythology and its players, Rogue One was a sophisticated and hard-edged reminder that there’s always been so much more to Star Wars than the Skywalker saga. Andor, from Rogue One writer-turned-showrunner Tony Gilroy, doesn’t at all stray too far from the tone, scale, or frankness about the human costs of warring with fascists that defined the film it’s building up to.

Since becoming an adult, I've felt like war and violence are often depicted in a very glossy way on screen. Either that or they are gratuitously showcased. So war is glamorized or gritty, with reality settling somewhere outside the bounds of the cinematic universe from which the films come. _Rogue One_ changed the way a _Star Wars_ property treated war, with its painful casualties and disappointing losses. It felt like the first _Star Wars_ film for adults. In a time when many "fans" accuse the changes in the _Star Wars_ universe of retroactively ruining their childhoods, a subsequent series that's unashamedly aimed at adults seems almost necessary.
