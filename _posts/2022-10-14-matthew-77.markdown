This week's Friday Night Video is a bit of a departure from other recent entries in the series. There's no electroclash or spunky cover reworkings. It's a new track from Welcome Wagon. Welcome Wagon are label mates of Sufjan Stevens and purveyors of a similar religiously-tinged folky aesthetic. With lyrics taken mostly from the gospel of Matthew and featuring comforting additions like "God holds your hand," the song centers around the passage in Matthew in which Jesus assures us that God knows how to give good gifts to His children. The text comes a chapter after Jesus tells his followers not to be anxious about anything, that God will provide for our needs. The title of the track specifically references the verse in Matthew that implores us to pray.

> Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. _(Matthew 7:7)_

The words from the passage are repeated in spoken word at the end of the song, giving emphasis to their power and hopefulness. There's no irony here, and, as a comment on YouTube stated, Welcome Wagon "lean straight up."
