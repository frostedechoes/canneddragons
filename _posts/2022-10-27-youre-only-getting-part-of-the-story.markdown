I have been writing a fair amount about bias in journalism and how it's leading to more polarization. [One such piece]( __GHOST_URL__ /sophists-and-frost-giants/) received a couple of (fair) remarks about how NPR had the most journalistic integrity out of the organizations I singled out. In terms of bias, I don't think NPR is the worst offender, but I can see clearly that the organization's view of the world shapes what it reports on and how those things are reported. I included NPR and Fox News in the same sentence on bias, and perhaps that was a bit unclear. After all, my wife and I are sustainers of our local NPR affiliate, WUNC, and I would certainly never say the same of an organization like Fox News (even if it was using a publicly sustained model).

After getting pushback about the comparison between the two very different news outlets, I thought about expanding my thoughts on the subject to illuminate where I see some similarities. I'll leave Fox News alone because I'm not really that familiar with them, at this point, but I've seen enough to know that their intentions are evident to most clear-thinking people. Despite "fair and balanced" being a previous slogan of Fox News, I don't think they get even close to approaching either. They've proven time and time again that they have a strong bias towards Republicans. I deliberately say Republicans and not conservatives because much of what comes out of the Republican Party these days bears no resemblance to traditional conservatism. Where the road splits, Fox follows the Republicans. If that includes giving airtime to baseless conspiracy theories or political insurrection, then that is where they happily go. It's not for nothing that they are being sued by Dominion, the maker of voting machines — [and losing key verdicts in the case](https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/16/media/fox-news-court-dominion/index.html) — for deliberately spreading lies about the company. I think the argument against Fox News fairness has been thoroughly made by the obviousness of their reporting slant.

### The Bias At NPR

The basic problem I have with NPR is that they project an air of objectivity, and I think many people buy into that marketing. They do this while pandering to the left to sustain the kind of emotion that drives people to subscribe to their programming. This is the [post-journalism model](https://human-as-media.com/2022/05/01/disinformation-is-no-danger-fear-polarization/). You need sustaining subscribers to keep your organization afloat, and you do that by honing in on a niche, but making that niche feel like it is the mainstream. In post-journalism, you advocate for your side of the story, rather than presenting both sides. Presenting another side of the story risks alienating your subscribers, thus endangering your source of income.

I was thinking about the best way to illustrate the bias at organizations like NPR when I came across [this digest post](https://intellectualoid.com/about/) from Reader John. In it, the blogger poses an interesting thought experiment about political extremes.

> Q: If the press labels someone “far right,” can you trust them?  
> A: No. The press does that regularly to move the Overton Window leftward, consciously or unconsciously.  
> Q: If the press labels someone “far left,” can you trust them?  
> A: I think so, because …  
> Q: Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Trick question. The press never calls anyone “far left.”

As they say, it's funny because it's true. Substitute "the press" with "NPR" and you have a match. I wasn't content to simply let this sort of humor get by without any empirical evidence, though. I actually did some searches on NPR.org to find out if the premise of the joke, which is so easy to accept, has validity. You can't swing a dead cat without hitting an article about the far-right on NPR (sorry, I love cats, don't @ me). All I had to do there was take a screenshot of the day's homepage.

<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src=" __GHOST_URL__ /content/images/2022/10/_homepage.png" class="kg-image" alt="The NPR.org home page" loading="lazy"><figcaption>The NPR.org home page</figcaption></figure>

Just to make sure I was on the "right" track, though, I also did a search for "far right" on the site. There were multiple results just from the past few days. When I searched for "far left," the stories were much fewer and farther spread apart. The only time I could see the phrase "far left" used in an editorial way was in articles about France. Apparently, that's the only place the far-left exists. Well, that and in the minds of those on the far-right. The other places that the phrase could be found was in quotes from right-wing politicians. Call it lazy empiricism, but I haven't done real research in a long time.

Why is it that NPR thinks there is a far-right so imminent and so close that it needs constant tracking and reporting, but doesn't acknowledge the far-left in any real way? To report on the far-left would risk losing subscription revenue that the organization counts on. It's much easier to play into their left-learning supporters biases and fears.

### What Does The Far-Left Look Like?

You may be thinking, _that's great, but the reason NPR doesn't report on the far-left is that it's not really a thing in any significant way_. So, what does the far-left look like? A good example would be an organization like "Jane's Revenge," that came out of the woodworks after the Supreme Court's decision in the Dobbs case. [Jane's Revenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane%27s_Revenge) is a militant pro-abortion extremist group. They claimed to have committed — or were suspected to be involved with — nearly twenty acts of terrorism and/or vandalism across the U.S. in just 3 months this year, after the Supreme Court case. They firebombed pregnancy centers and sent people death threats. Many news organizations, including Axios, The Guardian and the Washington Post, reported on these events. These publications are hardly bastions of conservative thought. If you're with me so far, you can probably guess how many of these events could be discovered on NPR.org. A big, fat goose-egg.

Reporting on abortion activists committed acts of destruction would go against the narrative that NPR is, quite literally, selling to their followers. The narrative is that abortion activists are only out for human flourishing, bodily autonomy and individual rights. To even imply that there are dangerous elements in the movement would offset their own activism regarding the subject. So, they just don't mention it, much to the relief and comfort of most of their listeners, who have bought into the NPR worldview.

### Erosion of Trust

All of these examples speak to why there is an erosion of trust in journalistic organizations like NPR. They can't be counted on to tell the full story when they are articulating only one side of the debate. Their reporting can seem like it's trying to propagandize for whatever the progressive argument is on a given topic. Other times, it may even feel fair, unless you know something about the subject being discussed.

When you have seen and heard enough stories to recognize the inherent bias, you can't trust the rest, where you might not be as familiar with the subject. Are they giving time to opposing views? Are they just articulating for one side of a complex issue? Are they ignoring nuance in favor of a clear, definable narrative? These are just some of the questions that you find yourself asking when doubt creeps in. I wouldn't counsel anyone not to listen to NPR, but to understand that when you do, you are only getting the part of the story that they want to tell you.

_I realize there is irony in the fact that I'm writing this as my wife sits downstairs in a NPR hoodie, but I'm willing to live in that tension._
