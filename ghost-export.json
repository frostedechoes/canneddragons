He makes some good points, although some of his examples of cancel culture might not be entirely accurate.\n\nWhat struck me, though, was a particular paragraph listing situations where people were trying hard to show their respect for the African American community.\n\nEach passing day sees more scenes that recall something closer to cult religion than politics. White protesters in Floyd’s Houston hometown kneeling and praying to black residents for “forgiveness… for years and years of racism” are one thing, but what are we to make of white police in Cary, North Carolina, kneeling and washing the feet of Black pastors?

Chief among those lessons is the fact that we are not in control of our lives. The feeling of control is exposed as illusory in the face of disease, accidents, tragedies and other circumstances which we could neither predict nor prevent. In Mio’s case, the positive thing about her accident and subsequent recovery was her newfound ability to let go.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"I faced this loss of control most acutely in my freshman year of college. I was in my second semester when a blow to the chest from a mere paperback book caused the subsequent appearance of a tumor. Fast forward a few weeks and I was in the hospital being treated for lymphoma. When you are eighteen years old, you feel invincible, like nothing is going to dramatically alter your life trajectory. You never even consider things like cancer or another potentially terminal illness. The faith of my youth, which had been dormant in the last few years of high school, became reinvigorated when I realized that I was not in control of my life (that’s a story for another time). I was blessed by, and at the mercy of, God’s providence.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Though I was sick, I could still do things and appreciate what possibilities each day would bring. That summer with no hair, fighting cancer with drugs that would put me out for a whole day at a time, was one of the best I’ve had in my four and a half decades. Life was down to its very elements. Very few thoughts of the future detracted from my enjoyment of the present. I didn’t sweat the small stuff. From then on, one of my biggest challenges as the years passed by, would be to do what I could to hold on to that way of framing things.\"]]]],\"ghostVersion\":\"4.0\"}","lexical":null,"html":"<p>Mio works at a record store in Gothenburg, Sweden (also home to one of the finest contemporary psych rock bands, <a href=\"https://hollowship.bandcamp.com/album/future-remains-lp\">Hollow Ship</a>).

Just not enough to expose myself to the red-faced mobs that seems to run Twitter these days.\n\nNow I spend a lot less time on Twitter in general. Most of my tweets are syndicated from a blog aggregation service with actual community guidelines - Micro.blog. I still think the Twitter product itself is very well developed and I miss what it used to be. When I’m on there now, though, I’m dodging true believers on my right and on my left. Let’s face it, Twitter wasn’t created to be a political platform. There is little room for explanation or context. I’m also avoiding tweet storms that would have been blog posts 10 years ago. Plodding through those threads feels a bit like reading a novel written on sticky notes. They are antithetical to the original design and intent of the service.\n\nTwitter has changed a lot over the last few years and it only seems to be slouching towards further decline. These days, there are usually many more edifying ways to spend time online.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/04/IMG_0681.JPG","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2021-08-10T11:53:53.000Z","updated_at":"2022-07-31T13:18:11.000Z","published_at":"2020-03-03T11:56:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"66b413767d0c0a178a2fe8f7","uuid":"e9e8851e-0648-4785-95a8-e68c78a835c7","title":"Fear and Loathing In These United States","slug":"fear-and-loathing-in-these-united-states","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"hr\",{}],[\"hr\",{}],[\"hr\",{}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"__GHOST_URL__/2020/01/10/we-demand-a.html\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://text.npr.org/966498544\"]],[\"sup\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"#fn1-15499\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://blog.ayjay.org/your-periodic-friendly-reminder-of-a-very-inconvenient-truth/\"]],[\"strong\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://micro.blog/books/1481304747\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"#fnr1-15499\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"By most accounts, evangelical Christians are concerned about the path this country is taking and encroaching restrictions on religious liberty.

It could have come from Matt Foley.\n\nI love Mike Cosper and he does a fantastic job with the production values of his podcasts, but I pretty quickly realized I had no interest hearing about this particular figure and his job church. The whole situation is alien to my experience of the church, since the denomination that I am part of, PC(USA), doesn't have celebrity pastors. You won't find dudes in thousand dollar sneakers trotting around a stage. Instead, you will find people (women included) typically preaching in traditional vestments, preaching from behind an old fashioned pulpit.\n\nI've witnessed this behavior in multiple documentaries.  ↩︎\n\nHe would be the Bobby Knight kind of coach, throwing chairs and screaming all the time.  ↩︎","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/09/driscoll.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2021-09-06T23:59:22.000Z","updated_at":"2022-09-05T13:55:09.000Z","published_at":"2021-09-07T00:02:49.000Z","custom_excerpt":"Mars Hill Church reveled in being Christian the manly way.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"66b413767d0c0a178a2fe8fc","uuid":"89cd562e-079e-4513-8109-37dd765d170d","title":"Duett - Leisure","slug":"duett-leisure","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<iframe style=\\\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\\\" src=\\\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2805852485/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=7137dc/tracklist=false/artwork=none/transparent=true/\\\" seamless><a href=\\\"https://duett.bandcamp.com/album/leisure\\\">Leisure by Duett</a></iframe>\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"em\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://synthrecords.bandcamp.com/\"]]],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Duett has been around for a while, but just came to my attention via Bandcamp's Instagram account last week.

The trailer for the show promised exciting visuals and an intriguing plot. The review from the site Common Sense Media was mostly very positive. The write-up on the show focused quite a bit on the show's diverse cast and little on the violence. The quick summary on the site encapsulates their review well:\n\n\"Cerebral sci-fi drama has diversity, some violence.\" Representation is important, but I'm ashamed that we've become so saturated in violence that we consider the level this show contains barely worth mentioning.\n\n\nFictional violence\n\nIn the universe of Foundation, a powerful empire rules over many planets. In a scene from episode two, we are shown how the empire responds to acts of terrorism. They find scapegoats for the act and target vengeance upon token individuals from the scapegoated populations in a town square setting. The indviduals are masked and made to stand on the edge of a building rooftop with a neuse tied around their necks. Each faceless character was kicked off of a roof to hang by their surely broken necks. The show wasn't shy about stretching this out, showing each individual being kicked off one a time and their dead body twisting in the wind. It was reminiscent of what Saddam Hussein used to do with people that he wanted to eliminate. While this was happening, weapons of mass destruction were being deployed on the entire populace of two planets, while their ambassadors wailed and screamed at the fate of their fellow citizens back home. During the incredibly visceral ordeal, crowds, shown on the balconies of their spartan apartments, cheered in triumph. What made the scene even worse for the viewer was knowing that the people being punished were not guilty of any wrongdoing, but were simply the targets in an exercise of force. They were victims of an act of genocide for show. When the show was over, a traumatized boy is brought over to the hanging dead bodies. He asks if they ever handle these situations differently and is told no.\n\nViolence in television and movies has become so mainstream that even sites specifically created to surface it aren't up to the job.\n\nIn the same episode, we see one of the protagonists brutally stabbed to death by his protege, his life blood oozing across the floor. The murder is done with no context, and is shocking. The frantic scene that follows gives no more information on why the murder happened. The viewer is left, potentially emotionally damaged, all in the service of trying to squeeze a cliffhanger in to draw people into the next episode. It's crass and manipulative.\n\n\nReal-life violence\n\nWhen I was in the eleventh grade, I lived in Albuquerque, NM, which was, at the time, second in the nation in gang activity. It could be a rough place and in high school, you learned to keep your head low (literally, lest someone you looked in the eyes think you were mad dogging them). The high school I went to was the same high school that Neil Patrick Harris attended, though he was two years ahead of me and graduated the year before I was there. That same year, a boy from the school was killed in the parking lot because he had allegedly said something bad about his murderer. I only heard stories, but I'm sure Harris remembers the incident, which would have happened when he was a senior. The part that disturbed me most about the stories that I heard was that a crowd had gathered around the conflict and were chanting, \"kill him.\" I can never get that out of my mind. The bloodlust of the crowd depicted in Foundation brought back for me the ugly reality of human nature.\n\n\nWhen sense is no longer common\n\nThis show and its evaluation on the Common Sense Media site shows that I can no longer rely on that site for giving reliable information with which to judge whether a show is too violent (for me, or my kids). Violence in television and movies has become so mainstream that even sites specifically created to surface it aren't up to the job.

The next time I listed the item, it went through a week without any bids, at which time eBay automatically lowered the price a bit (which is a cool feature). Almost immediately after it was lowered, I had a bid for the asking price. I accepted right away. Almost as quickly, I had a message from the buyer that he had a question and wanted me to text him. I replied that I would answer any questions over the eBay messaging system. I got another message that was the same as the first. I let a couple of days go by, and with no other word, called eBay. They told me to cancel the sale and confirmed my suspicion that scam artists were on the lookout for sellers with low ratings. I asked how I’m supposed to sell in that environment, but the support rep had no response to my question.\n\nI’m not sure how people would get started selling on eBay at this point, being at the mercy of successive scammers. I’ve heard Craig’s List referred to as “Flake’s List,” so I’m not sure things are better over there. Where are people selling online these days, I wonder?\n\nThank you to all of the people who left helpful comments when I originally posted this on Micro.blog.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/07/IMG_0704.JPG","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2021-11-26T18:02:02.000Z","updated_at":"2022-07-31T00:22:36.000Z","published_at":"2021-11-28T00:11:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":"With scams abounding, it’s hard to know where and how to sell goods online.","codeinjection_head":" <style>\n     .post p:first-child:first-letter {\n  float: left;\n  font-family: futura;\n    border-right: 2px solid #529ECC;\n  font-size: 75px;\n  line-height: 60px;\n  padding-top: 5px;\n  padding-right: 8px;\n  padding-left: 3px;\n  margin-right: 15px;  \n} \n     \n</style>","codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"66b413767d0c0a178a2fe911","uuid":"d4d6047c-34bd-4857-be6a-fb2f37ce3f04","title":"WandaVision Collateral Damage","slug":"2021-03-08-wandavision-collateral-damage","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"hr\",{}],[\"hr\",{}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://opuszine.us/posts/what-does-wandavision-owe-westview\"]],[\"em\"]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Over at Opuszine, Jason Morehead \"],[0,[0],1,\"has a detailed examination\"],[0,[],0,\" of what the WandaVision experiment put the citizens of Westview through and what they are owed in the narrative.

Nowrasteh describes one particularly popular style of article that has been around for the last few years.\n\nJournalism and commentary also thrive on unconventional narratives that cultural commentary is well suited to produce. “This culturally innocuous thing is actually evil” is so ubiquitous that it should be its own genre with a specialized name.\n\nThis genre (whatever you want to call it) has me wondering what this Christmas season's version of Don't Subject Your Kids to Rudolph is going to be. These stories are another version of the man bites dog aphorism in journalism.\n\nThe phrase man bites dog is a shortened version of an aphorism in journalism that describes how an unusual, infrequent event (such as a man biting a dog) is more likely to be reported as news than an ordinary, everyday occurrence with similar consequences, such as a dog biting a man.\n\nIt's not hard to write and back these pieces, because all they require is a knowledge of the cultural artifact, the shared accepted meaning behind that artifact and a different opinion. Some may roll their eyes, but it's hard to really contest such a piece in any real sense.\n\nGiven the low-cost at which these articles can be tossed out, and the high rewards of readership, don't expect them to disappear anytime soon.","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1605418524574-0159244a11be?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MnwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDN8fEN1bHR1cmV8ZW58MHx8fHwxNjM5MzY0MDIy&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=2000","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2021-12-13T02:53:23.000Z","updated_at":"2022-07-31T13:18:13.000Z","published_at":"2021-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":"<style>\n    .post p:first-child:first-letter { float: left; font-family: futura; border-right: 2px solid #529ECC; font-size: 75px; line-height: 60px; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 8px; padding-left: 3px; margin-right: 15px; }\n    \n</style>","codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"66b413767d0c0a178a2fe917","uuid":"44f42365-230e-4fd1-8e64-6a355da725b5","title":"America Defeated Itself","slug":"america-defeated-itself","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/12/boebert-massie-gun-photo/620942/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/03/guns-are-threat-body-politic/618158/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/12/michigan-shooting-chris-murphy-newtown/620881/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.newsweek.com/barack-obama-says-congress-lack-action-after-sandy-hook-was-angriest-day-his-presidency-1547282\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.theonion.com/no-way-to-prevent-this-says-only-nation-where-this-r-1819576527\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"In America, those that lived during the time of World War II are often referred to as \\\"The Greatest Generation.\\\" Their level of self-sacrifice and dedication to their country and to freedom around the world will long be remembered by history.

Especially the beginning of hypnosis, called induction, which is designed to put you into a state of relaxation in which you are more susceptible to suggestion. The watching of the breath, the attention on sensations in the body that focus and settle your mind are integral to both beginning hypnosis and to mindfulness meditation.\n\nWhen Cassandra Jenkins begins the song “Hard Drive” with spoken word, it feels like a hypnotic induction.

The sad part is, since there are no approved treatments for ME/CFS, I now get ads for cancer drugs served to me by the Twitter algorithm.

I guess you have to give something up in exchange for cultural capital (and ad dollars).\n\nWhich, of course, is what Pitchfork has always been about, projecting a certain kind of image of yourself to your peers. Pitchfork is the apotheosis of music purely as signifier, signifier of being the right kind of person, the cool kind, the knowing kind.\n\nExcept for the occasional feature that gets linked to from somewhere else, I stopped reading Pitchfork years ago. I think it was when they were intellectualizing low-brow, mainstream hip-hop. Things like “When Chingy says, ‘I like the way you do that right thurr,’ he’s really launching a scathing critique of contemporary sexual mores.” They probably still do that kind of music criticism. I’m just not tuning in to find out.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/08/a4055764750_10.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2021-12-26T19:12:29.000Z","updated_at":"2022-08-17T16:51:41.000Z","published_at":"2021-10-13T23:00:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":"The music magazine's reviews are changing with the way the wind is blowing.

It is certainly indebted to the Factory Records sound. While this track sounds inspired by Joy Division, another single, “Tell Me,” sounds more like New Order. It’s clear where Spectres influences lie.

What I found most interesting about this revelation is that it's not really one at all. I remember an interview with him on NPR in 2016 where he talked about then head of the ERLC for the Southern Baptist Convention, Russell Moore. Falwell accused Moore of being a \"closeted liberal\" and said that those who were scolding Donald Trump for his behavior should remember the woman at the well and not throw stones (conflating two different biblical accounts from the gospels). He picked up some religious references along his life's journey, but that seems to be about it. So the biggest surprise itself was that people were surprised by his admission.\n\nRussell Moore's response was that the junior Falwell never really disguised who he was.\n\nFalwell Jr. frequently spoke not in terms of the gospel or the way of Christ, even parenthetically, but in terms of decidedly Machiavellian political aims and objectives. When individuals questioned the cost to Christian witness of merging evangelicalism with populist demagoguery, he often dismissed them as though they were morally preening puritans, out of touch with the real world.\n\nWhat are those people who believed in Falwell going to do when they find out Donald Trump is not actually religious?\n\nFreddie deBoer wrote some thoughts after being told a book was \"taken down\" on Twitter. In this sense, \"taken down\" seems to colloquially mean something like \"entirely refuted.\" deBoer takes a stance that is not expressed often enough: Something like a book refutation is not possible within a limited medium like Twitter.\n\nThere is no such thing as a damning review of a book in tweet form. Such a thing is beyond the affordances of the medium. A longform book review can do more, but has limits of its own. A book review can be cutting, if it’s rigorous enough - and yes, a certain length is a prerequisite for rigor. A book review can be informative and humorous and generative and entertainingly mean. I write some myself and hope to achieve such goals. But no review alone can rebut an argument expressed over hundreds of words. It might be better, or at least easier, if it were so. But we live in a world of irreducible complexity, and our efforts to wrestle it into digestible chunks to match diminishing attention spans - well, that last part is exactly the contentious issue at hand - don’t magically make life simple enough to understand through maxims or fortune cookies or tweets.

The focus on Tatooine seems to be more about keeping the production budget reasonable than in service of telling a coherent or compelling story.\n\n\nMichael Descy https://micro.blog/mjdescy/12427198\n\n\nI can understand where Descy is coming from. Tatooine was supposed to be a backwater, and it has shown up in the various Star Wars properties more than any other location. Boring life on that planet was what caused Luke Skywalker to whine most unflatteringly when we first met him in A New Hope. Now as viewers, we find ourselves stuck there. I had never wondered if it played so prominently because it was cheap to film in a simulated desert setting. That might be taking too cynical a view, though, especially considering the formidable amount of resources Disney can surely contribute to a Star Wars project.\n\nOn the blog this week, I shared a post about the recent controversy with Spotify. I like to boost what other people have written about a given subject, and this is probably the most hyperlink-dense post I have written. I'll be interested to see how this situation plays out for Spotify.\n\nUltimately, it is up to the artists and the consumers if they want to engage in some sort of abstinence regarding Spotify. Whether the protest works with Spotify is up to the company. Folks can blast big tech for censorship, but in a case like this, Spotify is going to respond to what will be acceptable to their customers and also protect their investments in music and podcasts.\n\nWill putting content warnings before all podcasts that contain discussions placate their critics? Somehow, I doubt it.\n\nOf course, controversy is not new to Spotify, and the biggest ongoing controversy is the pittance they pay artists for streaming rights to their music. Many times, artists have no say in the deals, and couldn't pull their music from Spotify even if they wanted to because of the record label's level of control. Some would say this issue, so long contested, is bigger than the Joe Rogan controversy. There is also a strong argument that this topic is less divisive than a subject like Covid vaccines that has entered into the culture war territory. Theoretically, unless you are an executive at Sony or Spotify, you should be supportive of the artists (especially when you look at the data).\n\nlemme put it this way if instead of getting 300 million dollars joe rogan was also getting .003 cents per stream that he then had to split with a record company that was a part owner of spotify i would be standing in solidarity with joe rogan\n\n— nigh eve6 (@Eve6) January 31, 2022\n\n\n\nJason Morehead had a wonderfully informative piece this week on what happens when fantasy tabletop RPG's bring in science fiction elements. Specifically, he profiles two new games, Starforged and Quest: Cosmic Fantasy Edition. Something that is particularly intriguing to me about Starforged is the ability to play without what they call a guide (what other games typically refer to as a gamemaster or dungeon master). This alleviates the need for heavy planning and allows for both co-op and solo play. I confess that the only way I can play D&D with my 9-year-old is to play an NPC to help guide him, so a co-op resonates with me. I also really appreciate the artwork by Joshua Meehan. The worldbuilding feels quite thorough. Morehead writes:\n\nWhat I appreciate the most about games like Starforged and Quest: Cosmic Fantasy Edition is how they can fire up one’s imagination even before you play them. As I’ve mentioned before, I’m a sucker for good worldbuilding — and for tools that empower others to build and explore their own imaginary worlds.\n\nI can totally relate. I bought games like Mechwarrior (which was almost impenetrably difficult to play) when I was a kid because I wanted to live in that world, piloting one of those massive machines.\n\nJason Morehead is currently offering a 50% discount on memberships to his site/newsletter, Opus. His work is well worth supporting.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2022-02-04T16:34:44.000Z","updated_at":"2022-07-31T13:18:15.000Z","published_at":"2022-02-05T17:05:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":"Another Olympics in China, getting into solarpunk, the Tumblr CEO slips away, the Book of Boba Fett, the musicians who hate Spotify and the intrigue of Starforged.

I wonder if it would be helpful to remember the turbulence of the sixties, just to have some frame of reference for comparison, but it doesn't seem to be doing much good for my mom's outlook. She's just as exasperated with our current climate as the rest of us.\n\nWhile he doesn't offer much in the way of solutions, David Brooks presents the problems in a clear light, in this appropriately frighteningly titled piece America is Falling Apart at the Seams. He talks about the anger, the selfishness, the violence and the despair that are increasing in measurable ways. Perhaps most of us have heard this too much, lately. I wouldn't be bringing this up, though, if I wasn't comforted by reading an alternate perspective. There are actually those who, despite frustration, are trying to create a more virtuous cycle in a fractured environment.\n\nJamie Santa Cruz writes for Plough magazine about how she came to terms with the different perspectives of her friends on virus prevention and maintained close relationships that were threatened by strain. She relates the difficulty of reconciling herself to the beliefs of one of her friends.\n\nMaddening, this gap between us. Symbolic of many other gaps between her and me – on politics, on faith, and on all things touched by those two. Gaps that didn’t exist last time I saw her but that have become far more obvious these last two fraught years.\n\nIt’s hard for me to justify bending to the consciences of people who object so strenuously to basic public health measures. Should I submit my moral scruples to hers? But my friendship with Eliza goes back almost twenty years, and it has run deep. I didn’t really want to throw it out and suffer yet another Covid loss.\n\nSo many prize being right over relationships. Ultimately, Santa Cruz chose a different path while on a vacation. She was to meet up with her old friend during her travels. When her friend \"Eliza\" didn't want to go caving in a place they required masks, she gave in and agreed to meet at alternate location. It was not without resentment that she changed plans, though. Then, Santa Cruz came down with Covid and Eliza was there to take care of her needs, saying nothing of the irony that her cautious friend was the one who ended up getting sick. She picked up groceries and refused to be reimbursed. Santa Cruz spent the rest of her vacation thinking about her friend's generosity.\n\nThe Covid story doesn't end at the kind deeds done by Eliza, though. After her own bought with Covid, Santa Cruz had another friend who was immunocompromised yet still refused to get the Covid vaccine contract the virus. Her first reaction was feeling like her friend had made her bed and needed to lie in it, but then she remembered how she was treated when she was sick and decided instead of gloating or frustration, she was going to take the giving path. She asked her friend if she could get groceries to help out. There, in the midst of deep divisions, was a way to pay it forward.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/06/Week_of_groceries.jpeg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2022-02-10T04:15:34.000Z","updated_at":"2022-07-31T13:18:15.000Z","published_at":"2022-01-20T04:27:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":"<style>\n.post p:first-child:first-letter { float: left; font-family: futura; border-right: 2px solid #529ECC; font-size: 75px; line-height: 60px; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 8px; padding-left: 3px; margin-right: 15px; }\n    \n</style>","codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"66b413767d0c0a178a2fe933","uuid":"941eef3f-7135-457f-b8e6-729093a7cac2","title":"Issue No. 9","slug":"issue-no-9","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"email-cta\",{\"showButton\":false,\"showDividers\":false,\"segment\":\"status:free\",\"alignment\":\"left\",\"html\":\"<p>Welcome to another issue of Week on the Web.

One of the most striking essays came from Kay Hanley, Letters to Cleo songwriter and co-executive director of Songwriters Of North America. She has some bones to pick with Spotify CEO Daniel Ek.\n\nWhen recording artists complained about the absurdity of having to get millions of streams just to make minimum wage, Daniel Ek told us to work harder and release more music. Spotify executives have said in public that music creators are “entitled” for wanting our fair share while base pay for a software engineer is just south of $200K.\n\nAnd where are we now? Ek uses the billions he’s made off our work to do very not music business stuff like invest in AI defense tech, and endow a global chit chat platform to a fascist-curious jock. It’s the type of shit that would have put a terrestrial music distributor out of business at any time in music history previous to this one. Spotify sucks. Let’s take our awesome product and go where we’re wanted.\n\nI understood that Spotify was underpaying musicians and I remember the flippant comment that Ek made about artists needing to release more music. It wasn't until recently that I realized just how bad things are, though. Perhaps it's the fact that they are paying Joe Rogan many magnitudes more than the musicians upon whose backs they built the service. Or it could be that they promised musicians better compensation when revenue started to materialize and then instead took them to court to be able to pay them less. All these things combined mean I never want to have anything to do with Spotify.\n\n→ We Need To Talk About Spotify | Spin\n\nFr. James Martin on how a Christian should respond when someone who was not vaccinated dies of Covid.\n\nThe problem is that even a mild case of schadenfreude is the opposite of a ‘Christian value.’ Jesus asked us to pray for our enemies, not celebrate their misfortunes. He wanted us to care for the sick, not laugh at them. When Jesus was crucified alongside two thieves, he says to one of them, according to Luke’s Gospel, not ‘That’s what you get,’ but ‘Today you will be with me in paradise.’ Schadenfreude is not a Christian value. It’s not even a loosely moral value. …\n\nTotally agree. Schadenfreude is not a Christian value. However, to point of the previous piece that I linked to: is it okay to have that attitude towards companies like Spotify and Facebook when they lose a ton of market value? The Supreme Court may say that companies are individuals but I for one still can’t get on that train.\n\n→ How Do You Respond When an Anti-Vaxxer Dies of Covid? | NY Times\n\n🔗 via Joyce Garcia Buxton\n\nLooks like Meta and Spotify are heading in the same direction.\n\n— Kate 🤍🇺🇸 (@ImSpeaking13) February 3, 2022\n\n\n\nMichael Hobbes has a video essay making the rounds that examines whether “cancel culture” is really a threat to America. The problem with the articles, and in this case, videos, that seek to convince us that cancel culture isn’t real is that there is always a pretty good example of cancel culture in the recent past. In this case, you could cite Whoopi Goldberg as a decent representation of someone who was at least temporarily canceled unjustly for being ignorant on a subject of race. Or a guy who works at West Elm. You won’t have to go far back, at any given time, to find someone being punished for a misstep. It could be a professor who is has been reproached and is penitent for something like showing Othello, and for whom apologies and sackcloth and ashes are not enough to satisfy angry and traumatized students. You many even be reminded of cancel culture every day, if you use Firefox as your web browser. Former CEO, Brendan Eich (who created javascript and went on to found the Brave browser), was removed from Mozilla for monetarily supporting Proposition 8 in California. The Brave browser literally wouldn’t exist without cancel culture. Regardless of what you think about the marriage law (which was overturned), in this country, political speech in the form of donations to a cause is protected. Not only was Eich fired, but he was harassed by activists for years afterwards because of his politics.\n\nTucker Carlson and other Fox News talking heads hyperventilating aside, we may reasonably disagree as to the extent to which our new orthodoxies threaten the republic. To pretend like cancel culture, by whatever name you want to refer to it, is not real, though, is to say, “who are you going to believe, my think piece or your own lying eyes?”\n\nAs more companies like Meta and Microsoft start showing off VR tech, there seems to be something commonly missing from the avatars… legs. Since this is a phenomenon across multiple implementations of virtual space, Ivan Mehta wondered why. It turns out that it’s unusual to have VR sensors that take our legs into account.\n\nA lot of that has to do with sensors. Currently, metaverse experiences are largely restricted to VR headsets; some are compatible with handheld controllers, like the Oculus touch controllers. However, there are hardly any commercially available sensors and controllers for our legs. That means your leg movement can’t be accurately detected and depicted in virtual environments.\n\nWhat would be the consequences of having legs that moved in the virtual universe without us moving them in real life?\n\nHe also pointed out that in real life when you look down, you’re used to seeing your legs are at a specific distance away from your face, which you’re used to. But in the virtual world, if that situation is not replicated, it could cause you to feel nauseous. So until there are better sensors to avoid this on headsets, companies might avoid creating legs.\n\nYikes, I don’t imagine the disorienting feeling that would cause nausea would make VR very pleasant. So for now, the legs will have to be conspicuously absent.\n\n→ I found out why metaverse avatars don’t have legs | The Next Web\n\nBrothertiger is one of my favorite bands, and I was pretty stoked when I came across their cover of the full Tears for Fears album Songs From The Big Chair on Apple Music. I was able to listen to it a couple of times, then, poof, it was gone. I guessed that it was the result of some kind of cease-and-desist order from the legal arm of Tears for Fears. It looks like I was right because what is probably about 2 years after the album showed up and disappeared, it showed back up like a dream deferred. Only now, it's got an extra goofy title to obscure the fact that it's a Tears for Fears cover album. The album is cheekily now called Brothertiger Plays: Covers From That One Really Good 80's Band.\n\nFans of 80's mainstream synth pop or chillwave need to give this one a listen. It's just faithful enough to the originals to retain their impact, but also has enough of the Brothertiger glo-fi to modernize the classic tunes.\n\nFavorite track: “Everybody Wants to Rule the World,” obvs.\n\n→ Brothertiger Plays: Covers From That One Really Good 80's Band | Apple Music\n\n\nFrom the blog\n\nWorth the WaitJulia Kwamya invites you to Feel Good About Feeling Bad with an incredibly smooth mixture of dream pop and disco.Frosted EchoesRobert RackleyElevator Pitch BeliefsSteven Colbert does an amazing job summarizing the foundations of his belief in two minutes, but that doesn’t satisfy everyone.Frosted EchoesRobert Rackley","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"status:free","created_at":"2022-02-12T01:16:42.000Z","updated_at":"2022-07-31T13:18:15.000Z","published_at":"2022-02-12T17:00:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":"Spin magazine thinks we need to talk about Spotify, schadenfreude isn’t a Christian value, cancel culture is a thing, legless avatars in VR and Brothertiger outsmarts Tears for Fears.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"66b413767d0c0a178a2fe934","uuid":"493f9797-c0ec-407e-9655-6e4151142b34","title":"Pop Psychology and the Decline of Marriage","slug":"pop-psychology-and-the-decline-of-marriage","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/06/Divorce-love.png\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"width\":1640,\"height\":654}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/06/tylerquote.png\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"href\":\"https://twitter.com/tylerhuckabee/status/1476627762714664960?s=21\",\"width\":1600,\"height\":1000}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://mereorthodoxy.com/modern-psychosocial-imaginaries/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/30/opinion/divorce-children.html\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://text.npr.org/818495802\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://t.co/PlNaqEycp9?ssr=true\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/12/divorce-parenting/621054/\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"It turns out that not everything I learned in college en route to getting my psychology degree has held up under the weight of time and scrutiny.

Perhaps you could say that school curricula has always been a contentious subject, but it still feels to me like there’s a shift happening here when removing a graphic novel from a middle school course becomes “Nazis are banning books in Tennessee.”\n\n→ Cantakerousness (and more) | Tipsy Teetotaler ن\n\nI follow the blog of DHH from Basecamp, but I pretty frequently find myself disagreeing with his perspectives. He tends to reliably come from a pretty right-of-center perspective. When I do concur, though, his arguments strongly resonate with me. This usually happens on the subject of social media. He has recently argued that friction is necessary in online interactions. The absence of some kind of friction has given license for people to quickly spout off on social media without first really thinking about how they are interacting with others or what they are saying.\n\nFrom his latest essay, DHH relates that, after leaving social media, and making blogging and email his main forms of communicating online, he has noticed debate becoming a lot more civil. He’s even been posting hot takes on such contentious topics as Canadian truckers and getting reasoned, but differing perspectives.\n\nBut what's interesting is how I can envision all of these interesting, courteous, and illuminating email debates rerendered in the realm of Twitter to predictably nasty, bitter outcomes. BY THE SAME PEOPLE!\n\nIt's not that there's a new subspecies of homo sapiens inhabiting Twitter, and then another living on email. It's the same people. But the change in environment prompts them to flip from that resentful, incriminating stance in the one area to the curious, good-faith stance in the other. That's both fascinating and heart warming.\n\nIt's evidence that humanity hasn't been terminally broken. Even in places like America where it might so often seem like it. We are currently trapped in some bad platforms producing bad outcomes, but the people participating often just need a change of venue for the dark clouds to clear.\n\nI have reduced my reliance on social media in the last few years to where I think I’m in a healthy place. I have noticed that interactions via email tend to be much more rewarding and complete.\n\n→ This just wouldn't happen on Twitter\n\n\nFrom the blog\n\nPop Psychology and the Decline of MarriageShaky psychological theories have taken on an outsized role in the culture and may be detrimental to our relationships.Frosted EchoesRobert Rackley","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"status:free","created_at":"2022-02-19T00:07:03.000Z","updated_at":"2022-07-31T13:18:15.000Z","published_at":"2022-02-19T17:00:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":"Thinking about a vibe shift, subscriptions may not make revenue predictable, churches shutting down online worship services, books that are not really banned and a change in venue could reform even Twitter trolls.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"66b413767d0c0a178a2fe936","uuid":"a151cf60-762c-4b09-af09-2bf8b103ee71","title":"Brothertiger “Torn Open”","slug":"brothertiger-torn-open","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<iframe style=\\\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\\\" src=\\\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=241345882/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=fe7eaf/tracklist=false/artwork=none/transparent=true/\\\" seamless=\\\"\\\"><a href=\\\"https://brothertiger.bandcamp.com/track/torn-open-feat-yvette-young\\\">Torn Open (feat.

I can post from many different apps, including my favorite text editors. However, Micro.blog is the least reliable service that I use. The premium features like bookmarking and, most importantly for me, newsletters, are not well-supported. There are several high severity bugs in the newsletter service. While I’ve received acknowledgement of the bugs, there has been no visible movement on correcting them.\n\nFor now, I remain with Ghost primarily for blogging, but I would also like to try the simple Hey World service from Basecamp. Hey World is a sort of spiritual successor to the blogging service Posterous. Posterous allowed you to post through email and I enjoyed using it until Twitter bought and absorbed the company. Hey World lets you easily do RSS, newsletter and a traditional web log all in one. I was inspired to try it after an email exchange with Andy Nicolaides, who sang the praises of the simplicity of the tool and who, like me, is comparing it to Ghost. Ghost is a fantastic tool, but it’s geared towards monetizing your blog, something that is not even on my radar. Could my new favorite text editor be an email client?\n\nI’ve been trying out the Hey email service, and have been impressed with innovations it brings to email. It makes you want to use email more. The only downside is that you may finding yourself emailing more people, more often, but not receiving many responses. Not everyone, it seems, is having as much fun with email as those using Hey. Hey World comes bundled with the Hey email service, for no additional charge. For those of us who don’t plan on making money from our blogs, it makes a good value proposition.\n\nConsequently, this may be the last weekly digest I send out for a bit while I get my tooling figured out. I plan to keep blogging regularly, though. Thanks for coming on this ride with me, and I hope you’ll stay connected.\n\nMuch has been written about the heroism of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. One of my favorite pieces is this one by K.B. Hoyle at Christ and Pop Culture. When searching for a comparable literary hero to Zelensky, Hoyle lands on Faramir, from the Lord of the Rings. She quotes a passage uttered by the character on warfare.\n\n\"War must be, while we defend our lives against a destroyer who would devour all; but I do not love the bright sword for its sharpness, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the warrior for his glory. I love only that which they defend.\"\n\nHoyle writes:\n\nThe stories we tell of heroes like Faramir explain not only why we love a man like Zelensky when he steps reluctantly onto the world stage, but also why he behaves the way he does at a time of great need.\n\nIt is heartening to see the way the world has rallied around a real-life hero like Zelensky, who models the humility and courage we long to see when times are dark. It’s also disheartening to think that this is a guy our own president tried to blackmail like a common criminal.\n\nEpic Games, the makers of Fortnite and famous Apple antagonists, have acquired universally well-regarded streaming music service Bandcamp. I have a lot more faith in Bandcamp than Epic, so I’m not sure how to take this news. As a consumer who wants to do what I can for artists, Bandcamp doesn’t leave much to be desired. I’m just hoping Epic doesn’t degrade the service in some way.\n\nIn a release, Epic said Bandcamp will help it build out a marketplace for artists and creators. The company has said previously it is aiming to create a virtual ecosystem, dubbed the metaverse, where users can purchase art and other items directly from each other.\n\nEpic is local to me. They are building a large campus on the site of the mall where I used to work for Babbage’s, selling Playstation games and taking pre-orders for limited N64s from zealous Nintendo fans. It will be interesting to see if any Bandcamp jobs come to the site.\n\nNPR has a piece by Neda Ulaby highlighting the speed at which trends are coming and going now. Ulaby refers to fashions and aesthetics coming back into style as “the nostalgia loop” and notes that the loop used to be about 20 years (remember 70’s style singer/songwriters coming back in the 90’s), but that new technology players like Tik Tok have acted as accelerants to that cycle.\n\nBut the nostalgia loop has sped up. \"So much faster than twenty years,\" says Rebecca Jennings, a senior correspondent for Vox who covers internet culture . Jennings points to TikTok videos nostalgic for makeup trends dating all the way back to...2016, when makeup artist Mario Dedivanovic was busy breaking the internet by contouring Kim Kardashian's cheekbones and dramatically boxing her brows. Or look, Jennings says, to last year's much-hyped vogue for wired headsets, a vintage accessory dating all the way back to before the advent of wireless ear buds — around 2015.\n\nOf course, the article couldn’t have been completed without mentioning the “vibe shift,” which is ultimately the same phenomenon Ulaby is discussing in her piece.\n\nMatthew Guay has a post on the Reproof blog about notes apps and what kind of usage we actually get out of them. His view is that the main value of collecting notes, whether in an analog notebook or notes app is to get them off of our brain. Something nags at us that we will come back to the information later, so to clear our minds, we capture the text. Rarely, though, do most of us come back to most of the notes we take. Guay estimates that prolific notetakers (👋) return to about 1% of our captures.\n\nThat first step of emptying your brain was what actually mattered, though. Most of our thought and the random things we discover aren’t actually valuable. We’ll write them down then never give them a second thought. You could get the same value by writing them down, then setting fire to the paper and scattering the ashes to the wind.\n\nAlmost.\n\nHe goes into the tendency of those of us who take copious notes to fiddle with systems, in the hope that we’ll find one that’s just right for our workflow. It his strong conviction that we’re just tilting at windmills. We’ll never find the perfect system that enables us to take advantage of all of the information we bring in. Guay cites the Field Notes motto, “I’m writing it down to remember it now,” when he argues that letting these things go is the biggest benefit to processing information the way that we do.\n\nDan Primacy writes for Axios about the early failure of Donald Trump’s app and network Truth Social. Despite all of the warnings to keep an eye on the space, Truth Social is on life support within weeks of its launch. The big issue with adoption of the network seems to start with the big liar himself. Trump has never used the network.\n\nTrump hasn't posted a single time since the launch, despite an international crisis that has captivated the country. Instead, he's given his comments to radio and TV hosts — including one this morning with Dominion conspiracy theorist Maria Bartiromo — plus via his CPAC speech.\n\nHopefully the neglect continues and this thing folds sooner rather than later. The question then becomes: How do you solve a problem like Maria?\n\n\nFrom the blog\n\nImprecatory PrayerI had never come across the phrase “imprecatory prayer” until recently, even if I knew well what it meant. In fact, I have struggled with the concept. The Got Questions site begins to answer the question of what imprecatory prayer is by defining imprecatory.

The assessment seeks to answer the question of what differentiates you as a leader. The premise is that you can’t make a leader great by taking an area where they are weak and making them a bit stronger in that area so that they become potentially average. However, if you can take something they are already good at and make them great at it, you can augment the skills of someone who can actually influence others.\n\nWhen I took the survey, my strongest areas were honesty and integrity. We decided to hone in on those areas for my leadership development activities. Given the identification of strength in those areas and a commitment toward further development of honesty and integrity, I am sensitive to distrust. There are all sorts of ways people can express distrust these days. I wrote a post describing a few of the ways I have felt distrusted in the past. Distrust can involve individual or group dynamics. It can be the result of previous negative experiences that have conditioned someone to be doubtful of either other’s intentions or their presentation of truth, as I outlined in the piece. However, there can also be ex ante distrust built up by the media we consume that tells us to look askance at anyone with views outside our adopted tribe. These can come from being in an epistemic bubble or an echo chamber.\n\n\nThe echo chamber\n\nIn a piece for Aeon magazine, C Thi Nguyen describes an “epistemic bubble” and an “echo chamber.”\n\nAn ‘epistemic bubble’ is an informational network from which relevant voices have been excluded by omission. That omission might be purposeful: we might be selectively avoiding contact with contrary views because, say, they make us uncomfortable.\n\nThere is a crucial distinction between the two.\n\nAn ‘echo chamber’ is a social structure from which other relevant voices have been actively discredited. Where an epistemic bubble merely omits contrary views, an echo chamber brings its members to actively distrust outsiders.\n\nWhen even friends or family members impugn your honesty, despite all evidence that you are a credible source of information, you can infer that perhaps they are living in an echo chamber.\n\nHere’s a basic check: does a community’s belief system actively undermine the trustworthiness of any outsiders who don’t subscribe to its central dogmas? Then it’s probably an echo chamber.\n\nI hesitate to use the phrase “drinking the Kool-Aid” because of its dark origins, but it’s a colloquialism that everyone in English-speaking Western culture understands. People inside these echo chambers form their opinions before all the available evidence is present, based on what their media has fed them, and then, post hoc, come up with arguments on which to base their positions. Intuition drives the emotion, and the rational mind follows. They are fed by outlets like Twitter, which serve to amplify confirmation bias and algorithmically create and sustain echo chambers.\n\nJonathan Haidt (whose book I just finished), starts his latest piece for the Atlantic by invoking the biblical story of the Tower of Babel. The story comes from the first book of the Bible, Genesis.\n\nBut the Lord came down to see the city and the tower the people were building. The Lord said, “If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them. Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.”\n\nThe scattering of the people who built the tower and the confusion of their language so that they could no longer communicate has striking parallels to modern America. Haidt makes the connection for us.\n\nBut Babel is not a story about tribalism; it’s a story about the fragmentation of everything. It’s about the shattering of all that had seemed solid, the scattering of people who had been a community. It’s a metaphor for what is happening not only between red and blue, but within the left and within the right, as well as within universities, companies, professional associations, museums, and even families.\n\nHe goes on to detail the ways in which our society has broken down and fractured, hastened by the rise of social media. The piece dives into viral dynamics. It explains how tweaks such as the Facebook like and, more powerfully, the Twitter retweet, served to germinate online mobs and the behavior that accompanies mob mentality. Haidt calls this a stupefaction process, indicating that it inhibits clear thinking. As the quote above states, this doesn’t just happen between an “in group” and an “out group,” it happens within groups (both on the left and the right).\n\nYou can see the stupefaction process most clearly when a person on the left merely points to research that questions or contradicts a favored belief among progressive activists. Someone on Twitter will find a way to associate the dissenter with racism, and others will pile on.\n\nI’ve seen this play out in real life, even when the topic of discussion has nothing to do with race, and it’s not pretty. Ideas and people are shut down, cursed by an epithet with which almost no one wants to associate. The term “demonize” becomes appropriate, and its etymology tells us all we need to know about the severity of that characterization.\n\nWe don't talk a lot about actual demons, these days. However, Alan Jacobs writes about being absorbed into the demonic realm by powers beyond our control. The ability to escape this realm starts with recognition.\n\nNow, as it happens, I am myself a Christian, but I do not write here to issue an altar call, an invitation to be saved by Jesus. Rather, I merely wish you, dear reader, to consider the possibility that when a tweet provokes you to wrath, or an Instagram post makes you envious, or some online article sends you to another and yet another in an endless chain of what St. Augustine called curiositas — his favorite example is the gravitational pull on all passers-by of a dead body on the side of the road — you are dealing with powers greater than yours. Your small self and your puny will are overwhelmed by the Cosmic Rulers, the Principalities and Powers. They oppress or possess you, and they can neither be deflected nor, by the mere exercise of will, overcome. Any freedom from what torments us begins with a proper demonology. Later we may proceed to exorcism.\n\nOnce we recognize how these urges toward animosity are creeping over us, we can begin to act. In the case of social media, action may mean reworking your method of engagement. You could refine the list of people you follow. You might realize abstinence is the only way you can properly shape your experience. Whatever may bring down the temperature and ill will towards others is advisable. Then you can begin to see the humanity in even those with whom you disagree.\n\n\nNo one is an island\n\nWhile I believe that self-care is important, I also hold strongly to the belief that human flourishing is a collective enterprise. As John Donne said:\n\nNo man is an island,\nEntire of itself;\nEvery man is a piece of the continent,\nA part of the main\n\nIgnore the gendered language from the time period, as this is man in the universal sense. No one is an island, merely buffered against the waves that others make in the ocean. We are, in fact, connected with others in a way that protects us against the tempests that rage and threaten to destroy. John Donne was an English writer and cleric, but his metaphor works well with the composition of the United States. In the continent that Donne uses as an illustration, we are states that are federalized, all claiming our own identities, but coming together in overarching principles and common goals. We share topology and natural features like rivers and mountains that span across the lines that divide us one from another.\n\nI would write that, unless you are living alone in the woods, your connections matter. However, even Thoreau, who staked his claim alone beside Walden Pond, went back to civilization to work and have his mom do his laundry. We need our neighbors and the connections we have to each other. Our species cannot thrive without functional reciprocity and mutual growth. It's past time we started being more careful about how we engage in the activities that undermine relationships. Let's set new standards for ourselves and our conduct, knowing that together we can benefit each other. Rather than contracting, and sealing ourselves in our chambers, we can expand one another, broadening our horizons.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/06/8696717750_43a5323677_b.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"members","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2022-04-14T01:24:50.000Z","updated_at":"2022-07-31T13:18:16.000Z","published_at":"2022-04-15T00:30:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":"We are trees rooted alongside each other, and tearing up the roots of one tree threatens to encroach on the rootedness of another.","codeinjection_head":"<style>\n.post p:first-child:first-letter { float: left; font-family: futura; border-right: 2px solid #529ECC; font-size: 75px; line-height: 60px; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 8px; padding-left: 3px; margin-right: 15px; }\n    \n</style>","codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"66b413767d0c0a178a2fe942","uuid":"9ac180fa-099c-46b1-9e41-7b009e09fc99","title":"Issue No. 16","slug":"issue-no-16","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"email\",{\"html\":\"<p>Hey {first_name, \\\"there\\\"},</p><p>Welcome to another issue of Week On The Web.

Throughout our elementary school years, he and I shared a deep and abiding love for all things G.I. Joe. We hunted down the elusive Snake Eyes figure together. We turned our grandparent's spare room into a miniature theater of play warfare. I remember meeting him one time and he had setup a whole battle scene in my grandfather's caddy while on the way to pick me up. He and I discussed comic book intrigue and far-fetched military plots. There was one difference in our collecting, though. His parents bought him every G.I. Joe toy that he wanted. He had almost every action figure, vehicle and play set that rolled off the production line.\n\nDespite the largesse of my cousin's collection (or perhaps because of it), he was fastidious about the condition of his toys. I distinctly remember getting to his house and wanting to use his new Major Bludd figure in our play, but he refused to take the plastic mercenary from his box. The 3.5\" G.I. Joe figures were mostly well designed, but they didn't hold up well with excessive play. Their joints succumbed to wear and their arms and legs became floppy, like they had a connective tissue/screw disorder. Sometimes, the hook that connected to the rubber band, which held their upper and lower torso together, busted through their crotch. The missing plastic codpiece gave them a look that was most pitiable among Hasbro manufactured men. My cousin understood well the ravages of time and use on an action figure and would rather look at his pristine toy soldier than risk the soldier's health and manhood in the play wars that raged.\n\n\nRationing your music\n\n\nI've been thinking about all of this recently as I decide how to listen to music. I've been squirreling away some of my favorite tunes, including the new Ronnie Martin album, From The Womb Of The Morning The Dew Of Youth Will Be Yours. I don't want to \"wear out\" my favorite songs from too many listens. It's more than just the degradation of the polyvinyl chloride that the record is made from. It's also the diminishing level of pleasure that comes with repeated spins. I want to retain the feeling of intentionality and the enjoyment of discerning that comes with savoring the music. This feeling seems to be mostly confined to music that I have on vinyl, as there is a layer of friction in taking the record off the shelf, extracting it from its many layers of protection and putting the needle down on the spinning platter. Digital music is just too easy to play, skip past and move on. Its retention seems more ephemeral, no matter how good the music is.\n\nOf course, I still listen to albums like Dinosaur Jr.'s You're Living All Over Me quite frequently, despite the fact that I own copies on CD, cassette, 2 different colors of vinyl and digital and have been listening to it since 1992. As I grow older, though, the music that holds my fascination for years like the tunes from my youth is harder to find (even though I love a lot of it for short periods of time - 2022 has been great so far).  \n\nI will play my Now Sounds playlist over and over again without worrying about diminishing returns. I constantly refresh it with new music and that keeps the dopamine hits coming. It's a different model than what I employ with the work I truly treasure. In fact, I find myself avoiding putting new songs from albums that I really adore as a whole on playlists, so I won't get tired of individual tracks and ruin the enjoyment of the album in total.\n\n\nDoling it out\n\n\nDoes anyone else ration things that they enjoy? Do you ever find yourself saving \"the good stuff\" for the right occasions, just to avoid making it commonplace? It can be a movie, a soundtrack, a meal, a desert or even a special book. What do you only dole out to yourself every so often to retain its specialness?\n","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/06/Yo-joe.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2022-04-16T19:46:44.000Z","updated_at":"2022-07-31T13:18:17.000Z","published_at":"2022-03-08T20:49:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":"Learning how to savor things and experiences.

I'm almost embarrassed to admit the second thought that popped into my head after reading the news. Yep, it is definitely with some shame that I tell you my disbelief was quickly followed by relief. I'm aware that may be surprising. It surprised me, too.\n\nI'm not certain that I've ever really spent much time writing about Elon Musk, but my feelings toward the man are not very positive. I have spent a lot of time (maybe too much) writing about Twitter, and its many faults. Recently, I took a Lenten break from Twitter and, when I came back, found it pretty unappealing. Someone once joked that the game of Twitter was to not be the person who was being talked about on Twitter on any given day. On the day I came back — Easter Sunday — that person (or those people, rather) was a crew of zealous, evangelistic Christians singing songs about Jesus on an airplane. My whole timeline was filled with what the extremely online call \"takes\" about this incident. It didn't leave me wanting more. After seeing recommendations from Twitter, which, as usual, seemed designed to spark outrage, I felt even less inclined to log in. So, I just haven't been on the platform much during this Eastertide.\n\nIn the midst of my neglect of the Twitter timeline, though, one thing that has been weighing on my mind is Twitter's financial future. You see, I'm a TWTR shareholder, conflicted about my distrust of the platform and being financially intertwined with its fate. I have been waiting for a chance to sell my shares at a reasonable price and get out. I now have a way to cash in my chips, not having gained much over the years, but at least some. If I wanted to wash my hands of the whole affair, I could be done with Twitter today. It is somewhat liberating.\n\nWhen I started writing this post, I thought I was probably mostly alone in my feelings. Then I read this from M.G. Seigler.\n\nAnd with the market now in a state of turbulence, the chaos of Elon Musk must have in some ways felt welcoming. A chokehold that felt like a warm embrace.\n\nI can't come up with a better metaphor than \"a chokehold that felt like a warm embrace.\" An online place that I used to love has fallen into the hands of a billionaire with an ax to grind, and I feel fine.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/06/AA37E90D-685D-47E8-8BEE-206C192A8741.jpeg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2022-05-02T01:12:12.000Z","updated_at":"2022-07-31T13:18:17.000Z","published_at":"2022-04-27T01:13:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"66b413767d0c0a178a2fe949","uuid":"a8f45da1-8be2-4ff6-9f88-ce39eda886c3","title":"Dance Music For Introverts","slug":"dance-music-for-introverts","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<iframe allow=\\\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" height=\\\"450\\\" style=\\\"width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;\\\" sandbox=\\\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\\\" src=\\\"https://embed.music.apple.com/us/playlist/dance-music-for-introverts/pl.u-jV89DmJIVYDE4\\\"></iframe>\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/dance-music-for-introverts/pl.u-jV89DmJIVYDE4\"]],[\"em\"]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Sometimes Apple Music inspires me by algorithmically playing fitting sequential songs after a self-made playlist.

The phenomenon is detailed by Odette Yousef in the NPR piece Orthodox Christian churches are drawing in far-right American converts.\n\nThose who have followed the influx of extremists into American Orthodoxy agree that those individuals are fringe within the church and are mostly concentrated in newly founded ROCOR parishes. But they also warn that it would be foolish to ignore them. Of particular concern are the ways in which these individuals are networking with outside extremist groups and broadcasting their ideologies in the name of Orthodoxy.\n\nI have to wonder to what extent Christians are leaving mainline or evangelical churches for Orthodox Christianity overall. The traditional American churches have changed in substantial ways to align with contemporary American cultural values. The piece on the book points out what a small minority the extremists represent within the Orthodox Church several times. However, it doesn't get at the number of people who are making the conversion to Orthodoxy, but who couldn't be painted with that brush. I suppose that wouldn't help with the narrative that is being woven here.\n\nAfter the last service I attended at a Greek Orthodox Church, I asked a member of the clergy if he could tell me one thing that has changed in the last fifty years. At first, he struggled and couldn't come up with an answer. Then, you could see the light bulb flicker on in his head. Some lines in one of the hymns in their hymnal had changed in the recent past, he told me, beaming with pride. That was all he could come up with, and he was clearly satisfied. There's a path of continuity in the Orthodox tradition. Even Catholicism, that ancient faith which traces the first Bishop of Rome back to Peter, the rock on which Jesus said He would build his church, doesn’t match the allegiance to tradition that is present in Orthodox Christianity.\n\nIt makes some sense then, as we watch other churches argue about traditional versus contemporary services, or whether worship should be changed to incorporate more gender-neutral language, that a certain segment of Christians would be attracted to the stability of Orthodoxy. The Reformers once accused the Catholics of innovation, but it’s now mostly protestant churches that change elements of belief and worship. From the perspective of this believer, the changes are sometimes helpful and sometimes not. “Ecclesia reformata, semper reformanda (the church reformed, always reforming),” is the rallying cry, but when do the reforms go too far? It can seem like, each time a substantial change is made, a schism — seen or unseen — takes place in its wake and a new church is born. It reminds me of dubbing cassette tapes as a kid. Whenever a copy of a copy was made, there was a palpable loss of fidelity. A little more noise to go with the signal.\n\nThe Orthodox Church is not without its critics among its own ranks, particularly for its reticence to speak out on atrocities unfolding in Ukraine as vociferously as it condemns issues like abortion. It seems as if the faith leaders could take a page out of Pope Francis’ book when speaking with a more comprehensive moral clarity. Whether former Protestants are moving to Catholicism or Orthodoxy, though, it’s interesting to see the shift to high-church alternatives that are more historically consistent in how their traditions are expressed.\n\nAs I witness this happening, I'm reminded of a story that has haunted me since I read it. The Green-Eyed Christ by Adam Roberts is a cautionary metaphorical tale of church splits and new doctrines. The story takes place in the fourteenth century (pre-reformation) and follows a painter, Mijnheer Jacco Heuschrecke. Heuschrecke unknowingly gains a power by which anything he paints will be created in Heaven. As is the custom of the time, he paints mainly religious works and soon there are 12 new Christs in Heaven, all trying to decide who is the real deal. When the painter runs out of blue paint, he paints a Green-Eyed Christ, who, being the 13th and by virtue of his difference from the others, claims to be the true Christ. He comes to visit the confused painter to tell him only to sketch fourteen representations of God — that an angel has told Heuschrecke to fully paint — and give them colored eyes. Heuschrecke is troubled by sketching more beings in Heaven to add to the confusion.\n\n‘They are already in Heaven,’ said the Green-Eyed Christ. ‘But weakly: like spectres, potentless, wandering here and there. A dab of paint will give them more substantiality in the eternal realm, but not so much as to be able to reassert the old, stifling order. And from this point the grace of God will pour down upon the world in a new way — in ten thousand variants, in new religions and new sciences, in a great flourescence of culture and life and possibility.’\n\n‘Will it be so?’ Heuschrecke asked. His initial shock, at having an intimate conversation with the saviour of all humanity, had settled, and now he found himself uncertain as to the merits of what this Green-Eyed Christ was saying. ‘Must it be so?’\n\n‘It is a new dawn, my friend,’ said the Green-Eyed Christ.\n\n‘But what of Holy Mother Church?’\n\n‘She will persist.’\n\n‘But broken — fractured?\n\n‘Oh yes. Broken as white light is broken into the rainbow.’\n\n‘Heresies will prosper, like rank weeds in a beautiful flowerbed? No, Lord, surely not! Rival churches will challenge the oneness of faith?’\n\nThe painter flees, vowing to finish the paintings of God and, therefore, bring balance back to Heaven. It is hinted that Heuschrecke never finishes his paintings, but we already know how the story ends.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/06/Charalambos.jpeg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"status:free","created_at":"2022-05-13T03:07:58.000Z","updated_at":"2022-10-16T03:19:46.000Z","published_at":"2022-05-14T23:00:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":"A new book traces a trickle of far-right Christians moving to the Orthodox Russian church seemingly to chase authoritarianism but is there more to the story?","codeinjection_head":"<style> \n    \n    .post p:first-child:first-letter { float: left; font-family: futura; border-right: 2px solid #5E81AC; font-size: 75px; line-height: 60px; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 8px; padding-left: 3px; margin-right: 15px; }\n    \n</style>","codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"66b413757d0c0a178a2fe8e8","show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"66b413767d0c0a178a2fe94d","uuid":"04e63697-8ca7-4676-ba15-1461357e2b05","title":"🎵 Full Moon Baby","slug":"full-moon-baby","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"embed\",{\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9Twjmn1XiU\",\"html\":\"<iframe width=\\\"200\\\" height=\\\"113\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/t9Twjmn1XiU?feature=oembed\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\",\"type\":\"video\",\"metadata\":{\"title\":\"Hollie Cook - Full Moon Baby (Official Video)\",\"author_name\":\"Hollie Cook\",\"author_url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/user/holliecookmusic\",\"height\":113,\"width\":200,\"version\":\"1.0\",\"provider_name\":\"YouTube\",\"provider_url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/\",\"thumbnail_height\":360,\"thumbnail_width\":480,\"thumbnail_url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/t9Twjmn1XiU/hqdefault.jpg\"}}],[\"hr\",{}]],\"markups\":[[\"em\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://blog.ayjay.org/42216-2/\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"I love how Hollie Cook is able to blend reggae and dream pop vibes on her new single, “Full Moon Baby.” I enjoyed Cook's first album, \"],[0,[0],1,\"Vessel of Love\"],[0,[],0,\" when it came out in 2018, but there's something unique about this track.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"This is how you do crossover.

I half expect to have nightmares with Paul Hollywood and his Siberian husky blue eyes shaming me for undercooking a pastry.\n\nMy oldest son just graduated from high school, right after turning 18. I'm still getting used to him being an adult (we're still working on the driving). When I rented the beach house, I did a double take at the listing of 3 adults on the confirmation, even though I had entered it. The new adult will be attending NC State in the fall, which means he'll be on the campus where my office is located. I can go and visit him in the dorms any time, which I'm sure he would love.\n\nI passed my AZ-900 Azure exam a couple of months ago, and I'm about halfway through preparation for the AZ-104, which is next in the Microsoft Learn curriculum. I would be further along if the tutorial videos that I'm watching didn't feature rebuilding VMs over and over again.\n\n\nReading\n\n\nRobin Sloan — Moonbound\n\n\nI read about this one from a couple of people. The book itself is dense, and at sometimes, its concepts a bit confusing. The writing is unique for science fiction, though, featuring a lot more color and wit than I'm used to from a book in the genre. Science fiction tends to be more earnest and straightforward, focusing more on world building than interesting prose. Sloan appears determined to rectify this. It should be enjoyable to see if he succeeds.\n\n\nNadya Williams — Cultural Christians in the Early Church\n\n\nThough we tend to revere the early Christians, Williams paints a picture of a Christian Church in the first centuries that had just as many goof ups, sinners, and apostates as we have now. The conditions in which these original Christians lived is one of my fascinations, and I've read several books now that at least touch on the subject.\n","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"page","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2022-05-28T13:44:52.000Z","updated_at":"2024-08-08T23:17:47.000Z","published_at":"2022-05-28T13:52:41.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":"<style>\n    .article-image { display: none; }\n    \n</style>","codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"66b413767d0c0a178a2fe952","uuid":"eff0e2a1-4846-4351-8df8-a8af2c7131a2","title":"🎵 Perfectly Out Of Time","slug":"perfectly-out-of-time","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"embed\",{\"url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okcTB71eY4E\",\"html\":\"<iframe width=\\\"200\\\" height=\\\"150\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/okcTB71eY4E?feature=oembed\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\",\"type\":\"video\",\"metadata\":{\"title\":\"Stray Fossa - Perfectly Out Of Time (Official Video)\",\"author_name\":\"Stray Fossa\",\"author_url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/c/StrayFossa\",\"height\":150,\"width\":200,\"version\":\"1.0\",\"provider_name\":\"YouTube\",\"provider_url\":\"https://www.youtube.com/\",\"thumbnail_height\":360,\"thumbnail_width\":480,\"thumbnail_url\":\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/okcTB71eY4E/hqdefault.jpg\"}}],[\"hr\",{}]],\"markups\":[[\"em\"]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Stray Fossa is a band that Apple Music kept pushing on me until I realized that I really liked them.

Cheri Baker points out that it's not just social media that plays with our emotions.\n\n\nI’ve decided to stop consuming American news media.

I knew something felt wrong as soon as I arrived at the church, though.\n\nWhen I pulled into the parking lot, I was immediately obstructed from parking in the small lot by a mammoth SUV trying to pull into in a tight place between the curb and another car. I waited as they backed up and tried to fit into the space. Just down from that spot, there was an almost empty entire row of spots that I was able to take advantage of as soon I could pass. When I parked and started walking towards the church, a couple had just gotten out of their cars. I tried to smile and say, \"good morning,\" but they averted their gazes. On my way in, I passed a car with the license plate that read 'Serbian.' Adorning the car were multiple National Rifle Association stickers. I felt a dizzying sense of cognitive dissonance. You know the strange camera angles that they use in films when they want you to see the world through the eyes of a character in crisis? That is what I felt. Wasn't I going into the house of the Prince of Peace?\n\nI couldn't get this contradiction out of my mind as I made my way into the sanctuary. I was barely greeted, so it made it easier to get lost in my own thoughts. My mind wrestled with different emotions as the liturgy commenced. There is little to do as a member of a congregation in an Orthodox worship service, which gives one time for contemplation. I thought back to this blog post I had written. Was the book that the post was based on and the NPR take on that book more accurate than I had been willing to recognize at the time?\n\nI have come to realize, over the years — as I looked at the imperfections of the members of the body of Christ — that a church and even its doctrines are not totally responsible for the beliefs or actions of its members. However, we are taught by Christ himself that \"a tree is known by its fruit,\" in the book of Luke. I once knew a woman in the church that had a troubled pregnancy. It was understood that her child would have physical abnormalities. A fellow parishioner told her she should have an abortion. She was horrified and determined to bear the child. It's now years later and her child is healthy, if not perfect. He is a source of joy to his parents. The child's mother never returned to church. I wouldn't hold the church accountable for the opinions of one of its members if the church presented moral clarity on the subject of abortion, but it doesn't. Therefore, the parishioner was only acting in accordance with the teachings of the church.\n\nPerhaps the Serbian was going against the teachings of the church when he chose to follow Moloch instead of Christ. The question is, though, what is the church teaching? While I've been attending, children have been murdered in their place of learning. Nothing has been said about it in any of the services I've been to. To be fair, in an Orthodox Church, you don't get much of a sermon. You get a homily that reflects on the content appropriate for the liturgical calendar. You have to wonder, though: Is a church that shuts its eyes to the evil just outside its doors doing an effective job carrying on the ministry of Christ? My Presbyterian church hosts meetings on how to stop gun violence. I got an email after the shooting pointing out ways to enter into dialogue with politicians to stop this scourge. I'm not on any Orthodox mailing lists, but I have to wonder if the members of this church receive the same sorts of materials.\n\nIt appears, from my observations (feeling somewhat like a cultural anthropologist), that the Orthodox don't engage much in worldly affairs. They seem to be so focused on their own worship that the need for Christ's teachings in the world gets little thought. Maybe I'm missing something, though. I would rather not judge a whole, complex faith based on a few visits to a specific worship service or one individual's errant beliefs. I would like to know, though, how the church behaves to bring the Kingdom of Heaven to earth, as we pray in the prayer that Christ taught us. As Brother James says in the book that bears his name, \"faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.\"\n\n\nThe place of church in the world\n\nHow it interacts in the world is an important measure of a church. The prophets taught us this as they again and again called for a society that took care of the least among us and upheld justice. They considered societal sin, which is why they consistently and continuously warned of society facing punishment for its evils. Many modern-day Christians deflect these teachings, though, and the teachings of Christ when they say nothing can be done about gun violence at a societal level. We heard, in the wake of the school shooting in Uvalde, that we can't stop violence that begins in the heart of a person filled with evil. Esau McCaulley effectively rebuts this view in a New York Times piece about gun violence.\n\nThe reason that some Christians cannot bring themselves to support gun law reforms, then, is the same reason some Christians cannot effectively battle racism beyond condemning individual racists. They have a deficient doctrine of sin and evil, limiting it to the individual.\n\nMcCaulley points out that tolerance of slavery was a societal evil, beyond what was in the hearts of any given individual.\n\nThey functionally recognize only one source of sin: the heart. Our faith has a much more complex account of evil focusing on the interlocking realities of the individual, the spiritual and the structural. The refusal to acknowledge systemic problems as they relate to gun control is a failure of theological imagination with ongoing deadly consequences. A full Christian account of evil leaves us with hard truths. Granted, the massacre of innocent children reflects an evil heart, but politicians and leaders set on giving evil hearts easy access to tools of mass death share some responsibility for that evil. These politicians and their supporters are part of the structural injustice that gives individual evil room to operate.\n\nA church that allows systemic injustice, without holding those who allow it to perpetuate to account, is not playing its prophetic role in the world. I'm not accusing any particular church of having that problem, but I like to see evidence to the contrary.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/06/orange-tree.770082c6ac3e4a0e8f56bbf8a6f5a57c-1.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"sent","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"label:me","created_at":"2022-06-19T21:42:51.000Z","updated_at":"2023-05-13T20:31:07.000Z","published_at":"2022-06-19T23:15:54.000Z","custom_excerpt":"How should believers from a church carry out their lives in society?","codeinjection_head":"<style>\n    .post p:first-child:first-letter { float: left; font-family: futura; border-right: 2px solid #529ECC; font-size: 75px; line-height: 60px; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 8px; padding-left: 3px; margin-right: 15px; }\n    \n</style>","codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"66b413757d0c0a178a2fe8e9","show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"66b413767d0c0a178a2fe95b","uuid":"a4d1f47b-e980-43dd-be33-ce71d7b62c16","title":"Ironsworn: Starforged","slug":"ironsworn-starforged","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"em\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"__GHOST_URL__/newsletter/issue-no-8/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.ironswornrpg.com/product-ironsworn-starforged\"]],[\"strong\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://twitter.com/joshmeehanart?s=21&t=apIUttto-oB0YUctWU8VIQ\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"I wrote about the sci-fi successor to the fantasy tabletop RPG \"],[0,[0],1,\"Ironsworn\"],[0,[],0,\" in the \"],[0,[1],1,\"Week on the Web newsletter\"],[0,[],0,\" a few months ago. \"],[0,[2,0],2,\"Starforged\"],[0,[],0,\" has now been officially releases in digital form, with pre-orders for the hard copy being taken as well.

Even in the vastness of the World Wide Web, escaping “the outrage” and reading and writing about something different can be difficult. So, I’m going to slow down on link posting in the way that I have been doing it. I’ll still be blogging. I just don’t want to commit to a weekly email, in case, on any given week, I just can’t find enough that I want to write about. At least not enough to write about without getting sucked into the outrage.\n\nI came back to publishing these newsletters because I really enjoy it and people have told me that they've found benefit in them. However, I'm once again wondering if this is sustainable. I have had to step back from social media — this time including Micro.blog. As people have become more comfortable with the medium, the tone of discourse has changed there. People are posting about politics more, and the posts are usually shrill and reactive. Micro.blog is no longer qualitatively very different from Twitter. I've had to stop following so many people that my timeline is looking a little thin. I'll be writing a bit more about this in a proper blog post. Mastodon seemed like an appealing service to check out, but who needs another social media site to read people complaining about the same things?\n\nI have certainly found some edifying thoughts on the subject of abortion, which I have included in this newsletter, but I won't make that a regular subject of discussion. There is enough of that to go around. Most of the discussion is being led by the most radical voices, who tend to be the same people who spend a lot of time online (especially on social media). I've posted about my respect for Elizabeth Bruenig before. If you want to see the worst of humanity, just look up \"Bruenig\" on Twitter.\n\nI'm hoping to get my family to go to church with me on Sunday. Last weekend, when I got home from church, my wife was watching a show called, \"How To Marry A Stripper.\" So, we have some things to work on.\n\n\nSeven Types Of Rest For Exhaustion\n\nEmma Beddington found herself dealing with massive fatigue and brain fog that wasn't going away. She decided to explore a book that promises to help someone rest in ways other than just sleeping.\n\nThe book is not, in fact, about that kind of complete withdrawal; it is about incorporating enough moments of rest to stay functional. That may be a depressing indictment of end-stage capitalism: Dalton-Smith is thoughtfully critical of society’s inability to take a preventive approach to its “burnout culture”, commoditising sleep (“It’s a billion-dollar industry, we have speciality pillows, weighted blankets, all of this stuff”) rather than focusing on the root problem. It is, however, refreshingly realistic. I gave the seven types of rest a whirl over a week, to see whether I would feel less tired – whatever that actually means – afterwards.\n\nAs someone who has struggled with debilitating post-viral fatigue and is recovering, the prescriptions for rest in this book sound helpful.\n\n\"Sure, we can sleep when we’re dead, but a little rest before that would be nice.\"\n\n→ The Seven Types of Rest: I Spent a Week Trying Them All | The Guardian\n\n\nA Lifetime Of Games Stolen\n\nJustin Heckert writes about the owner of a trade-in games store, Jason Brassard, who amassed a giant collection of rare video games in mint condition. Brassard took enormous pride in showing off his collection — until it was stolen and then recovered in poor condition.\n\n“Every single game that was in the safe was very deliberate,” Brassard says. “I had the ultimate copies of those games, I had really sought them out over the years. They were in there for a reason. I identified with those games. Like…people know Jason owns those games that no one else has. And I shared them. I had archived them, preserved them.” It felt, he said, “like a tragedy for the video game community more than anything.”\n\nNot to spoil the ending, but Brassard couldn't enjoy his games in the same way after the theft, and after they had been roughed up.\n\nDo not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal. But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. (Matthew 6:19-20)\n\n→ Jason Brassard Spent His Lifetime Collecting the Rarest Video Games | Vanity Fair\n\n\nLate-Stage Capitalism and Abortion\n\nJake Meador writes about the easy acceptance of violence that is cheap and costs us nothing, so we allow violations of conscience instead of taking on the burden of caring.\n\nTo take one example: A pathetic number of large firms in our nation have, since Friday’s SCOTUS ruling in Dobbs, said that they will provide funds to their employees who need to travel out of state to secure an abortion. Others have even said they will pay the relocation costs for any employees wishing to move out of a pro-life state. The reality behind this apparent “generosity”? An abortion is cheaper than maternity leave. As one of our contributors observed on Twitter over the weekend, it’s worth asking why so many firms with abysmal histories in labor practices are the first in line to pay for abortions.\n\nHe raises some legitimate questions about why large corporations are so eager to encourage women to have abortions. Financial gains are an easy place to look when determining the motivations of companies who, first and foremost, are beholden to deliver profits to their stakeholders. Meador goes on to cite our treatment of farm animals as another example of where we choose expediency over care.\n\nLeah Libresco Sargeant writes in Other Feminisms how she expressed a similar sentiment to Meador when she appeared on a New York Times podcast to discuss the aftermath of the Dobbs decision.\n\nSo it's true, you can look around and say, our culture has no room for the vulnerable. It doesn't have room for babies who are vulnerable and it doesn't have room for women who are vulnerable. So abortion is a crutch that lets us navigate that hatred of dependence that's pervasive in our culture. I think it's one more mark of a sexist society that we take the burdens we put on the vulnerable, then lay them heavily on women and demand an act of violence to have equal access to society.\n\nDependence requires care and effort. It is not efficient, materially profitable or pleasurable, so it goes against our contemporary societal values. If you require violence in order for women to be a part of your community, you are doing community wrong. If you require horrible treatment of animals in order for people to have low-cost food to eat, you are doing food wrong. Violence shouldn't be the cost of entry.\n\nNow, if only our Supreme Court would take a consistent stand on stewardship.\n\n\nRunning Doom On Furniture\n\nMichael Kan reports for PC Magazine on a project where software engineer Nicola Wrachien was able to prove the concept of running the old PC game Doom on an Ikea Smart Lamp.\n\nThe project marks the latest attempt to run Doom on a non-PC platform, which has included iPods, treadmills, and classic console gaming systems. Wrachien says his own work could be used as a starting point to “port Doom to almost any microcontroller featuring enough flash and at least 108 kB of RAM,” so long as the chip has enough processing power.\n\nGuess the lamp is actually pretty smart.\n\n→ You Can Run Doom on a Chip From a $15 Ikea Smart Lamp\n\n\n🕹 Summit Kingdom\n\nLaysara: Summit Kingdom is an upcoming strategy game by Quite OK Games that has you building and sustaining a kingdom on the side of a mountain.\n\nI don't play many video games these days, but when I do, it's usually because the game presents a world that I want to inhabit. A place that has intrigue or beauty. Managing a mountainside kingdom like a Tibetan Prince has enormous appeal to me. I could practically spend all day just looking at screenshots of these carefully built civilizations from a bird's-eye view. The fact that the game isn't concerned about defeating invading armies or invading other kingdoms is a plus for me. I can't forget those blood-curdling screams the orcs would make in Warcraft when they were coming to trash the buildings you had created. Laysara focuses mainly on staving off and surviving natural disasters (like avalanches — this is set on a mountain, after all) and kingdom management.\n\nEstablishing a flourishing city in harsh upland conditions is not an easy feat. Adjust your build strategy to gameplay-affecting vegetation zones and expand to more distant mountain slopes to reach scarce resources. Carefully plan production chains and satisfy various needs of your three-caste society while dealing with mountain hazards such as weather breakdowns and avalanches!\n\nIf only I had a Windows machine so I could play this!\n\n\nMissing Online\n\nJohn Carey, who has slowed his blogging considerably over the years, reflects on why he's not online more.\n\nMy biggest problem right now is still the act of trying to find enough confidence to share much of anything online. It feels like the older I get, the more alienated I feel within the online world. A lot of it has to do with its shifting focus and our lack of attention as trends in social media have moved to quick, rapid engagement. The tiny spike of adrenaline we get as images zip past our eyes for a few seconds and, like a slot machine, we pull down for more, and more, and more, until time and thought mean not much of anything. We blink. and look up from our phones with that dazed, cloudy look in our eyes, and try to focus on reality.\n\nCarey is an amazing photographer, who often used to share his photos as desktop wallpapers. His archives are available for those who want to liven up their monitors or devices.\n\n→ Reflect On | Fifty Foot Shadows\n\n\nFrom the blog\n\n🎵 The Finest Hour – PolvoSixty minutes of music from one of your favorite artists.

(1 Corinthians 1:10)\n\nI want to experience a Christianity that doesn't crack at every fault line.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/07/schism-tear.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2022-07-24T20:46:27.000Z","updated_at":"2023-05-14T11:41:55.000Z","published_at":"2022-07-13T20:49:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":"Experiencing a Christianity that doesn't crack at every fault line.","codeinjection_head":"<style>\n    .post p:first-child:first-letter { float: left; font-family: futura; border-right: 2px solid #529ECC; font-size: 75px; line-height: 60px; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 8px; padding-left: 3px; margin-right: 15px; }\n</style>","codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"66b413767d0c0a178a2fe962","uuid":"9ee4aa5f-81b7-4269-87f3-893f3f71ef77","title":"🎵 Always There","slug":"always-there","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<iframe style=\\\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\\\" src=\\\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=1108277072/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=63b2cc/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\\\" seamless><a href=\\\"https://thechurchhillgarden.bandcamp.com/track/always-there\\\">always there by the churchhill garden</a></iframe>\"}],[\"hr\",{}],[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<iframe style=\\\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\\\" src=\\\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=558017820/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=63b2cc/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/\\\" seamless><a href=\\\"https://thechurchhillgarden.bandcamp.com/track/halo-the-cure-cover-version\\\">halo (the cure cover version) by the churchhill garden</a></iframe>\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"em\"]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"The first thing that hits you from Swiss outfit The Churchhill Garden's \\\"Always There\\\" are the reverb(y) guitars.

I'm sending the newsletter out via Ghost this time. I feel like the hand-curated newsletter is a bit of rebellion against the Tiktockification of web culture. Cal Newport <a href=\\\"%20https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/tiktok-and-the-fall-of-the-social-media-giants\\\">has a piece</a> in the New Yorker on how TikTok may benefit the web by reducing the power of the big social media sites.

It's not exactly the \\\"town square\\\" for open dialog that it was once pitched to be.</p><p>I did a bit of rebranding on the website. I've always wanted to have some control over how I present my sites, in the way that a musician or group of musicians comes up with a band name and aesthetic.

But Baio has also found more interesting limitations. “Anything that’s an opposite, like a horse riding a man or a hand with six fingers, is a real struggle for it,” he said. “We want to think that DALL-E has this wild imagination and that it is capable of generating wildly unusual images, but because it’s been trained on tens of thousands of images of people with 10 fingers, it really struggles.”\n\nRumor has it that DALL-E will be opening to a broader beta cohort in the upcoming weeks. I'd like to play around with it, but I expect my images will be fairly pedestrian. I'm not into surrealism like the image generator's namesake.\n\n→ Tech's New Frontier Raises A \"Buffet of Unwanted Questions\"\n\n\nMonocropping In Cities\n\nClive Thompson writes about rewilding cities, in a new extension of his \"rewilding your attention\" concept. In the piece, he profiles cities that have ripped up roads made for cars in favor of rivers and public spaces. He compares the way cities have been built around the automobile to monocropping.\n\nIndeed, one thing we learned from the 20th century is that monocropping is freaking dangerous. Whenever we ploughed over fields and regions to plant a single crop, the land got weaker over time, because it lost that dense, gnarly, diverse spectrum of life. Farmers for centuries knew this, which is why they rotated crops and had a network of animal life interpenetrating small farms. But with big industrial farming, we monocropped, and created — decades down the line — crappier soil, entire regions susceptible to a single pest, and unexpected knock-on effects. (Like how industrial farming destroyed roadside milkweed, helping to decimate Monarch butterfly populations.)\n\nIt's an interesting concept that begs the questions of whether the cities that have \"rewilded,\" to some extent, are healthier for their inhabitants and in what ways that could be measured.\n\nIn his book The Life We're Looking For, Andy Crouch examines how we are increasingly building our environments around machines.\n\nThe great urbanist Jane Jacobs masterfully outlined, in her book The Death and Life of Great American Cities, the elements of an urban environment that make it a healthy place for human habitation: mixed-use buildings, plenty of chances for street-level interaction, limited traffic, priority for pedestrians. It is not much exaggeration to say that these are precisely the conditions that are worst for autonomous vehicles. The closer an environment is to being genuinely good for human beings, the worse it is for a self-driving car.\n\nHe writes of humans creating \"attenuated cultural environments that treat persons like machines.\" The effort to rewild cities is a pushback against this trend, and maybe even a necessary one if people are to flourish.\n\n→ Rewilding Cities\n\n\nFrom the blog\n\nAirshowA new podcast adjunct to a popular feed reader gets it right.Frosted EchoesRobert RackleyArc WelderA new browser makes the case for why it stands out from the pack.Frosted EchoesRobert Rackley","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2022-08-04T23:49:32.000Z","updated_at":"2023-05-14T11:41:55.000Z","published_at":"2022-08-06T15:00:36.000Z","custom_excerpt":"Relative sci-fi, living the asynchronous life,  just joking on social media, exploring what confuses DALL-E and monocropping in cities.

He argues that disruption serves the bored and that boredom is a luxury we no longer have, even in the U.S. — particularly after January 6, 2021.\n\nThat type of progress definitely generates a ton of activity. But it also sits weird when you consider how many lives in the world, historically and currently, including American lives, are extremely disrupted—by toxic spills or the whims of royalty or the goats all swelling up and dying. Disruption is an ethos for the bored, for people who live in reasonable climates and don't have tanks in the street. But America has recently become way less boring.\n\nDisruption was a big goal when things seemed to be stable. We wanted tools that upended the status quo. Now we've seen the effects of our efforts. Polarization, fragmentation, and decline seem to be the by-products of the disruption we once craved so heartily.\n\n→ Forget Disruption. Tech Needs to Fetishize Stability\n\n\nMetal Elizabethan Poetry\n\nJohn Donne was an interesting guy. He was an inveterate womanizer and poet turned pious preacher. James Parker profiles Donne for The Atlantic and brings in a metal comparison.\n\nSuper-Infinite is the title of Katherine Rundell’s new biographical study of Donne. It sounds like an album by Monster Magnet. And indeed, Rundell responds to Donne in something of a heavy-metal, hyperbolizing register. Read the first stanza of “Love’s Growth,” she promises us, and “all the oxygen in a five-mile radius rushes to greet you.” Another poem, “The Comparison,” in which Donne contrasts the charms of his mistress with those of another woman, takes the tradition of poets praising female beauty “and knifes it in a dark alley.” And so on.\n\nFor all his hyperbole, I'm pretty sure Donne didn't write about acid trips like Monster Magnet. Parker never mentions it, but another metal comparison would be Metallica, as they took their song title \"For Whom The Bell Tolls\" from Donne's writing.\n\n→ The Unlovable, Irresistible John Donne\n\n\nChristian Anonymity Online\n\nPatrick Miller writes for Mere Orthodoxy about Christian trolls hiding behind anonymity online. In the case he uses an example, having a female speaker at his church resulted in harassment for the speaker and for the church.\n\nA different speech comparison sharpens the issue further: the difference obvious between anonymous and non-anonymous accounts. If I, as a non-anonymous citizen of the internet, post something erroneous or incendiary, I can expect to have friends, coworkers, pastors, and family confront me. Knowing that is a gift. It causes me to restrain my tongue and keeps me out of a lot of trouble. The wisdom of proverbs applies in the 21st century, “Those who guard their mouths and their tongues keep themselves from calamity” (Prov. 21:23).\n\nMiller calls for personal accountability by way of being open about your identity in situations where you are critical. He debates calls from social psychologist Jonathan Haidt that we eliminate the ability to post on social media anonymously.\n\nEven if we reject Haidt’s proposal to ban anonymity online, that doesn’t absolve individuals of their collective, social responsibilities to one another. On a moral level, he’s correct. No one wants to live in that neighborhood. This is especially true for Christians who care to follow Jesus’s second great commandment, love your neighbor as yourself. We are obliged by our king not to build digital neighborhoods where anonymous bullying is encouraged, much less become the verbal vandals within them.\n\nIt's obvious on its face that the interactions Miller describes are unchristian. He brings up many passages of scripture throughout the piece which prove the behavior in question to be out-of-line with how we as Christians are called to treat each other.\n\n→ Speech Without Accountability: Reckoning With Anonymous Christian Trolls\n\n\nCatching Up With TikTok\n\nI wondered what happened when the deadline the U.S. government had given Apple and Google to remove TikTok from their respective app stores came and went. It turns out that other arrangement have been made. Sara Fischer has the details for Axios.\n\nIn June, after longstanding pressure from the U.S. government, TikTok said it had begun routing all its U.S. user data to Oracle's cloud infrastructure.\n\nApparently, TikTok has been working with Oracle since 2020 to lift some of the pressure that the former president was putting on them.\n\n→ Scoop: Oracle Begins Auditing TikTok's Algorithms\n\n\nThere’s A Middle\n\nThe deceased theologian Karl Barth (who once said to preach with the newspaper in one hand and the Bible in the other) is held in high regard by many modern Christians. Vika Pechersky has a piece for Mere Orthodoxy about Barth's warnings for evangelical theology speak to veering too far to the right or the left.\n\nThis brings me to my final point. Is it true that the modern man no longer poses any threat to contemporary theology or the Church at large, as Barth has suggested? The reaction of many Christians today, throwing themselves into the sea of culture wars with such vigor, indicates the opposite. Christians still feel threatened by the current iteration of the modern man—a self-defining and fluid human being. At the same time, a full embrace of this version of the modern man by the current liberal (and postliberal) side, proves once again that Christians of all stripes and colors are still reacting to the contemporary age, while offering no significant alternative to its dominant ideas or visions of the human life, saying even less about the God who revealed himself in the man Jesus Christ.\n\nStooping to align with or against cultural or political trends obscures the timelessness of the gospel. It also threatens to eradicate Christian distinctiveness.\n\n→ Karl Barth’s Warning for Evangelical Theology\n\nIf your reaction to a news story would be different depending on what party it involves, it's probably not ethics that's driving your reaction but politics.\n\n— Daniel Darling (@dandarling) August 13, 2022\n\n\n\n\nFrom the blog\n\nEngaging Your ReadersHow do you get readers to pay for your writing online?Frosted EchoesRobert RackleyMinimal MacI was texting with an old friend the other day, and he was documenting his progress in getting three monitors set up.

When tools for self-publishing on the internet started maturing, I relished the ability to easily write for others. Blogger's slogan \"push-button publishing\" strongly resonated with me. It really was as simple as they made it sound.\n\nI've found myself very attracted to indie software that lets an independent developer shape the course of their vision for users. Many times, the resulting software is perfect for independent users, who then adopt that same vision or fit their usage needs into the constraints. The last few years, I've been using the Micro.blog hosted blogging service to publish most of my words. The service has been a great way to write in my app of choice — several apps on the Mac support publishing to Micro.blog — and get my thoughts out to people who theoretically want to read blog posts. As Micro.blog got more functionality, it became easier to customize your blog and make it your online home. When there were issues, you could reach out to the developer, Manton Reece, and get help. Unfortunately, Micro.blog has grown in functionality, it has also increased in bugs and surface area to cover.\n\nMicro.blog is in a difficult place right now. It still only has the one full-time developer, but as it gains in users (particularly in light of the recent changes at Twitter) it also has more surface area to support. It's starting to seem like more than one person can handle. However, it's probably not yet in a place where it is bringing in enough revenue to be able to bring in another developer or someone to provide support.\n\nLate in the summer, I was at the beach and had some time on my hands to fiddle with the theme of my blog (this is what I do when I get a vacation). Unfortunately, I ran into problems with Micro.blog, where CSS variables wouldn't work, and my blog ended up in an in-between two themes state and looked pretty janky. I emailed help to see if I could get some assistance on the strange issues. At the same time, I ran into an issue with HEY email where the \"focus and reply\" functionality would work on my iPad. I emailed HEY at roughly the same time I emailed Micro.blog. I heard back from a super friendly HEY support rep the next day, and the bug was fixed within a week. It was two weeks before I heard anything back from Micro.blog and my issue was unresolved. It persists to this day, but I've used media queries and hard-coded values to work around it in most cases.\n\nDuring the past weekend, I ran into multiple bugs in Micro.blog. My newsletter took 11 hours to send. I tried to add my newsletter sign-up to my posts page, and it massively messed up the interface, for no apparent reason. I tried to switch themes to test my changes in another theme, and my blog got stuck in between themes and had elements of both, causing it to look really strange. The attempt to use the new feature to import posts to my blog via RSS from HEY World and the stylesheets on the post didn't work (ultimately, this was an issue with the HTML in the HEY World post).\n\nYou can like and admire an independent software publisher, but the software still needs to work.\n\nThey say that in order to write well, \"show, don't tell.\" Since I don't know how to show interesting bug reports (at least not in this format — I was a QA Manager for 10 years), I'll spare you additional details. This could get to be a pretty dry post. My point is that, if you're the sole developer of Micro.blog, you're going to want to focus on what your users want most. Right now, with the social media scene in the midst of a long-overdue fragmentation, that's interoperability with Mastodon. Many Micro.blog users, new and old, are testing this connectivity out. Meanwhile, though, whole features, like the newsletter, for which people pay a premium, are not working at all for some. Like any software product owner, you are going to decide to spend your resources where they are the most impactful. As I used to say all the time in my professional life, \"it's a consumption choice.\"\n\nEvery software feature has a total cost of ownership that doesn't end at the implementation of the feature. The cost of maintenance can be even higher than the price tag of initial development. If you don't keep this reality in mind, you may find yourself in over your head with a burden of support that is too great to bear. While it may be more fun and exciting to develop new features than fix bugs, and may even bring in more users, it can end up being at the expense of your existing user base.\n\nMaybe I take all of this a bit too seriously for casual software. None of what I said is meant to apply to professional, mission-critical infrastructure. As I've said before though, regarding blogging, this is my hobby. When you golf, you want the best clubs for the way you play your game, even if it is just a recreational activity for most.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/11/type-writing.093b0b8a10da437e85fe781cb7a99a7e-1.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"members","email_recipient_filter":"label:core","created_at":"2022-11-10T23:45:49.000Z","updated_at":"2023-10-12T19:27:20.000Z","published_at":"2022-11-10T23:55:10.000Z","custom_excerpt":"Think about the size of an independent publisher when assessing your needs.","codeinjection_head":"<style>\n    .post p:first-child:first-letter { float: left; font-family: futura; border-right: 2px solid #5E81AC; font-size: 75px; line-height: 60px; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 8px; padding-left: 3px; margin-right: 15px; }\n</style>","codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"66b413757d0c0a178a2fe8e9","show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"66b413767d0c0a178a2fe97e","uuid":"58f0650c-27e3-4431-8812-06fc20ce4166","title":"The Ghost of Jehovah","slug":"the-ghost-of-jehovah","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<p class='u-drop-cap--line'>This week I got the latest issue of Presbyterians Today, the periodical from the Presbyterian Church USA.

When I bring to the reading fresh experiences from my own life, I see the verses through different eyes.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"This year, one of the books I have discovered anew is the book of Jonah. Famous as being one of the most kid-friendly books of the Bible, Jonah has a lot more to it than the children’s adaptations present. Most of us are familiar with this Sunday School depiction of Jonah as the reluctant prophet, called to a foreign city to preach about God, attempting to run away from the task to which he is called and ending up in a “big fish.” After his encounter with the fish, Jonah realizes he can’t escape God’s will for him and does indeed travel on to Nineveh. However, most of the “Jonah and the whale” stories for younger children omit the the fourth and final chapter of the book completely. If you can put aside the whole guy getting swallowed by a big fish and having a change of heart thing, the last chapter is where the book of Jonah really gets interesting.\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"It is well understood from any reading of the story that Jonah fiercely resisted God’s command to go to Nineveh. If we put ourselves in the place of Jonah, the command from God was like being asked to go to Mosul under ISIS control and preach repentance. In fact, the city of Nineveh, to which Jonah was called, was located in the area of the modern day city of Mosul.

Corey Doctorow writes about the hardest thing regarding leaving social media.\n\nOnline, a lot of us have been unhappy with our social media platforms for a long time, but we hang in there, year after year, scandal after scandal, because as much as we hate the platform, we love the people who use the platform.We don’t leave because we don’t want to lose them. They don’t leave because they don’t want to lose us. It’s a hostage situation, and we’re all holding each other hostage.\n\nThere were so many times I almost pulled the plug on Twitter. The first time was after they changed their API to put impediments in front of third-party developers. I almost quit when things got rancorous in the run-up to the 2016 election. I almost quit — earlier this year — when bullies forced Elizabeth Bruenig off the platform and I saw user after user gloating about it. Finally, I almost quit after hearing that Elon Musk was buying the platform.\n\nI'm usually terrible about prognostications and the guessing of ulterior motives, but I did a pretty good job back in April, when I guessed that Elon Musk was planning on taking over Twitter because the conservative commentary site The Babylon Bee was banned.\n\nLast week, Twitter banned the conservative satirical site The Babylon Bee for what it termed “hate speech.” Specifically, the “satire” involved misgendering U.S. Assistant Health Secretary Rachel Levine as a man. I’m not sure what’s satirical about that, but it seems cruel and certainly not at all funny. As a sign of the coming apocalypse, Elon Musk was interviewed by the Babylon Bee in December 2021. Is it possible that this ban was the act which spurred Musk into thinking of buying into Twitter to change its direction?\n\nIt appears now, based on texts with his ex-wife, that Musk initially decided to buy Twitter for just that reason. I would link to what I've read, but well, it's on Twitter. I won't go back into the burning building just to grab it. Was this incredibly insightful on my part? Nah. It's better attributed to the predictable petulance of the billionaire who now owns the technology platform with the largest mindshare.\n\nI don't know if or when Twitter will go down. I think you can run Twitter with a lot less people than the company had prior to the Musk takeover. However, I also believe that you can't and shouldn't alienate your employees and cause the best to quit without repercussions.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2022/12/twitter-fail@2x.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2022-11-23T13:20:27.000Z","updated_at":"2023-05-14T11:41:57.000Z","published_at":"2022-11-23T13:20:44.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":"<style>\n    .post p:first-child:first-letter { float: left; font-family: futura; border-right: 2px solid #5E81AC; font-size: 75px; line-height: 60px; padding-top: 5px; padding-right: 8px; padding-left: 3px; margin-right: 15px; }\n</style>","codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"66b413767d0c0a178a2fe982","uuid":"2cd77352-6e94-4ee9-bf9f-1bcf7e6a6a5d","title":"When You Sleep","slug":"when-you-sleep","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<iframe style=\\\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\\\" src=\\\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=878547020/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=333333/tracklist=false/artwork=none/track=183256331/transparent=true/\\\" seamless=\\\"\\\"><a href=\\\"https://diiv.bandcamp.com/album/live-at-the-murmrr-theatre\\\">Live at The Murmrr Theatre by DIIV</a></iframe>\\n\\n<br>\"}],[\"hr\",{}]],\"markups\":[[\"em\"],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://youtu.be/oSm_5TQiccM\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://spaceecho.chromewaves.net/2022/11/17/diiv-live-at-the-murmrr-theatre/\"]]],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"Perhaps the definitive cover of My Bloody Valentine's \\\"When You Sleep,\\\" from their seminal album, \"],[0,[0],1,\"Loveless\"],[0,[],0,\", is Memoryhouse's \"],[0,[1],0,\"version from their 2010 \"],[0,[0],1,\"Yours Truly\"],[0,[],1,\" live session\"],[0,[],0,\".

It's not hard to imagine what they band could have been with a few more years under their belt.\n\nreturn by blue smileyreturn by blue smiley\n\nA more current band to watch is Knifeplay, which has been around since the demise of Blue Smiley, but is just now coming to my attention as they release a new double-LP entitled Animal Drowning. Their expansive sound encapsulates the best ethereal fuzziness of Starflyer 59's Gold and mixes it with some of the melody and scope of Smashing Pumpkins Siamese Dream. The result sounds like something that could have been produced by Alan Moulder in the mid-90s. A standout track is \"Lonely Sun.\" It's all carefully controlled chaos until the end, where the decomposition brings to mind the dramatic dénouements of the songs off Sonic Youth's Goo.\n\nAnimal Drowning by Knifeplay\n\nI'll be devoting more time to digging into Animal Drowning in the upcoming weeks to see if I'm ready for another record in my growing-too-big for its storage record collection. Buying new vinyl is the highest compliment I can pay to any band at this point.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/02/knifeplay.3055c557683845c9a6cccf649047c517.jpeg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2023-02-04T21:47:22.000Z","updated_at":"2023-05-14T11:41:58.000Z","published_at":"2023-02-04T21:47:49.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"66b413767d0c0a178a2fe98a","uuid":"48a9d552-29b0-4843-8e07-809c6674b374","title":"The Candy Culture Wars","slug":"the-candy-culture-wars","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://holapapi.substack.com/p/everything-is-a-war-now\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"John Paul Brammer \"],[0,[0],1,\"wades into the candy culture wars\"],[0,[],0,\" (which are adjacent to the chicken sandwich culture wars and seem to provoke no less depth of feeling, if not many true casualties) on his Substack.\"]]],[1,\"blockquote\",[[0,[],0,\"No one really asked for the M&Ms to be more relatable or for Velma to call out toxic masculinity.

Regardless of whether you disagree with how sexuality is handled in schools, to say that those on the other side have no human worth and that they want to hurt children is a tactic that represents some of the worst tendencies of discussion and debate. There are places, such as Sweden and Finland, that have an entirely different view of topics like gender medicine. Are the Swedes and the Fins hate mongers as well? Do they prize cruelty to children? Or do they have a debate about these issues without the sort of rancor that's taken for granted now in the U.S.?

There are places, such as Sweden and Finland, that have an entirely different view of topics like gender medicine. Are the Swedes and the Fins hate mongers as well? Do they prize cruelty to children? Or do they have a debate about these issues without the sort of rancor that's taken for granted now in the U.S.?

They hear the word, but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth, and the desire for other things come in and choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.\n\nStill others are like the seeds sown on good soil. They hear the word, receive it, and produce a crop—thirtyfold, sixtyfold, or a hundredfold.”\n\nI feel like the seed, in modern America, is sown among thorns. The worries of this life choke the word. My prayer is not only to have faith, but to be able to hang on to that faith in the midst of the thorns.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/04/83AAC001-3914-485E-8B13.jpeg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2023-04-17T01:19:19.000Z","updated_at":"2023-05-14T11:41:58.000Z","published_at":"2023-04-17T01:21:32.000Z","custom_excerpt":"A scholar makes the case that, if Jesus rose from the dead, that changes everything.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"66b413767d0c0a178a2fe98f","uuid":"199bd90e-4afa-4146-95a9-5696fefafc8d","title":"I'm Still Uncomfortable With Amazon","slug":"im-still-uncomfortable-with-amazon","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"__GHOST_URL__/2021/08/10/conscientious-consumerism-and.html\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"A couple of years ago, \"],[0,[0],1,\"I wrote about Amazon\"],[0,[],0,\" and my discomfort with a number of the practices that the company employed.

Although this piece by Zachary Small in the New York Times gets a little too ambitious with typography and integrating videos into the text, it's still a great read. The article goes into the history of the iconic Zelda games and the direction they are headed in, and underscores the legacy they have left.\n\n“Someone might write an entire university dissertation on a specific part of the worlds created by Tolkien,” said Ed King, a 26-year-old British gamer who translates the mysteries of the Zelda universe for his 700,000 YouTube subscribers. “Zelda lore isn’t quite on that level yet, but it does have depth.”\n\nSmall goes into detail about what has been changing in the franchise and focuses on the ability to combine certain elements into tools. The designers prototyped this in a modded version of the original game (I wish I could get my hands on that).\n\nMultiplicative gameplay encourages players to combine actions and objects in ways that allow for a vaster set of solutions.

I have to admit, at first, I didn't pay too much attention to the announcements. I used to believe OS updates could be life-changing, but that was before these operating systems reached the level of maturity that they have currently. Now, I have more of a casual level of interest in the evolutionary offerings that a new OS brings.\n\nOnce I took a second look at macOS Sonoma, a few things jumped out at me. One new feature that I could see myself using pretty heavily is web apps. Web apps could perhaps more appropriately be called site-specific browsers (SSB). They are a browser instance dedicated to a single site. This could be a web app, but it could also be any other page. It is likely that the feature will mostly be used for apps, though.

One reads, \"may they persevere to the end.\" I believe I've heard this before in the same, or similar contexts, so I think it is a pretty common saying under these circumstances. When I first read it, I wondered why there was such a strong statement of hope in our ability to run the race. I didn't understand why this race would be considered to be especially difficult or challenging.\n\nI think I'm beginning to understand the exhortation.

When I opened the package, I couldn't help but feel a bit left down. I had been waiting for two weeks, just to receive a slightly bent cardboard envelope sleeve with a CD in it. The packaging is so minimal, that I won't even be able to find the CD in my storage solutions because there is no spine from which to read the band name and album title. It feels like the presentation of the CD was done as cheaply as possible, even though CDs are already very inexpensive to manufacture, and their margins are high. The only bonus is that it includes a lyric sheet folded four ways. For this, I paid about $18 more than what I had been paying when I was listening to the album on Apple Music. I'm happy to be paying the artist for their music, but it feels like I'm getting the short end of the stick here. \\n\\nAfter getting the CD in the mail, I went to preorder another CD on Bandcamp. It's an EP from one of my favorite bands, so it was a foregone conclusion that I was going to buy it on physical media. Something happened at the virtual checkout counter, though. I looked at the total cost (CD + shipping + tax). To buy the CD and get it shipped to me was $22.50. That is for a package of 6 songs. It seemed pretty high to me given the incremental cost of that listening experience on top of my monthly streaming cost (which I'm not likely to give up) is nothing. \\n\\n### Packaging\\n\\nThen there is the matter of packaging, which is essentially — with digital music on a compact disc — what you are paying for. It's rarely advertised how the CD is packaged, so you could get almost anything now that there is no standard presentation for that format. I have recent CDs of all different shapes and sizes. Even multiple releases from the same band on the same label, like older Metallica albums, have different sized cardboard sleeves. I've had to buy various sizes of plastic covers for the sleeves on these albums. As I mentioned before, there is no way of knowing what you are going to get until your music arrives in the mail. I just got a Mudhoney CD in wallet style cardboard packaging, and it's inexplicably wider than other similar two CD sets. I can't even fit it in my storage containers, so it has to go with my box sets. It makes me miss when everything came in jewel cases or at least digipaks. \\n\\n### Vinyl\\n\\nVinyl has fairly standard packaging, and a differentiator from digital music you can find online is that it sounds analog. You are actually engaging in a changed experience with the music.  It's also usually nicely packaged because the record companies and artists view it as the premium way of releasing music, as opposed to CDs, which seemed to be viewed as an afterthought. However, you pay for that premium. The 6-song EP I mentioned earlier is $37.51 to purchase on vinyl (I hesitate to mention that it's almost sold out). I predicted, sometime around the mid-aughts, that vinyl would become the premium way to distribute music, but that it would continue to cost more and more.[^2] Boy was I on the money. \\n\\n### The Right Thing\\n\\nI'm all about paying musicians for their work. It feels like it keeps becoming difficult to do in a realistic way and the returns are either cost prohibitive or mysteriously poorly done.

Qobuz feels a bit like it has some of the UI DNA from Rdio, along with decent editorial content and lossless/hi-res as a first-class citizen. It markets itself as the go-to platform for hardcore music fans or audiophiles. Thankfully, in my experience, it lives up to its image, with an editorial sensibility that matches, high-fidelity music and an algorithm that pairs tracks you’ve played with similar music eerily well.\n\n\nAnother benefit to Qobuz is that, unlike Apple Music or Spotify, it works with Roon, a favorite tool of music enthusiasts. Roon has a good remote app, which is something I’m looking for since I want to play to music from my main Mac while I have my work laptop hooked up to my monitor. I tried the iTunes Remote app, but it only found part of my playlists (on a 58-song playlist, it found 6 songs). It also hasn’t been updated in years.\n\nComing from a consumer perspective, I get the sense that Apple is just coasting off name recognition and familiarity with respect to their music service. As a music fan, this isn’t enough for me. I would much rather give my streaming and purchase money to a company that is invested in the whole musical ecosystem and the experience. I’m dropping my Apple Music family plan to sign up for the Qobuz family plan.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/11/coltrane-blue2x..png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2023-11-17T17:51:25.000Z","updated_at":"2023-11-17T17:52:57.000Z","published_at":"2023-10-23T23:00:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":"Apple Music has done me wrong, but I found an appealing alternative.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"66b413767d0c0a178a2fe9b4","uuid":"55d8eece-039a-4163-a2cc-6df71a8dde9f","title":"Nevermind The Mainstream","slug":"nevermind-the-mainstream","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Ted Gioia \",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"writes about the battle between macroculture and microculture\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":null,\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"link\",\"version\":1,\"rel\":null,\"target\":null,\"title\":null,\"url\":\"https://www.honest-broker.com/p/in-2024-the-tension-between-macroculture\"},{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\".\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":null,\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"ChatGPT makes the distinction between the two cultures:\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":null,\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"In essence, macroculture represents the dominant cultural framework of a society, while microcultures are the distinct subgroups with their own customs and values existing within that broader framework.\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":null,\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"quote\",\"version\":1},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Gioia believes microculture is taking over after the 20th century was dominated by macroculture, and welcomes the shift.

In it, Rendle goes over the difficulty some have in choosing how to position their blog and what they choose to publish. He addresses his answer to someone named Katherine on Mastodon, who is worried about what to put out there.\n\nI’m sort of dragging the conversation in a different direction slightly here but what Katherine touches on is the oldest question on the internet: what should our personal websites do? Should we prioritize getting a new gig or selling a service? Or can we be ourselves? Weird and fun and peculiar? Should we talk about topic X but avoid topic Y? That’s a common one I hear from fellow bloggers. Or what if a potential employer doesn’t see the last big project we worked on? Are we hurting our future careers by blogging about fun recipes or books that we like? Isn’t that an unnecessary distraction from moving from an L3 to an L4 or whatever?\n\nRendle ends up coming down on the side of more individuality from bloggers. Instead of something fit for LinkedIn, he says, \"I want weirder, more broken websites!\"\n\n\nMeta Doesn’t Need to Federate to Get Your Data\n\nThreads, the fledgling social network from Meta, is closer (sort of) to fully implementing ActivityPub, which allows communications with other networks on the Fediverse, such as Mastodon.

As the city pop takes over, you realize just how bittersweet the lyrics to even the chorus are (\"I'm barely hanging on\") and it starts to dawn on you that she's talking herself into moving on from sadness (and an ex). The musical dynamic matches perfectly with the emotional movement in the song.\n\nWhen I found out that Daydreamer was produced by Jack Tatum, who also self-produced my other favorite record this year — Wild Nothing's Hold — it didn't surprise me. Tatum has collaborated with Burch, who is his labelmate, in the past. His production shines here, as it does on the Wild Nothing record. Synths softly accent, guitars both chug along with new wave verve and solo with tasteful restraint. Tatum knows just when to juice things up for the most impact, and it comes across not only in \"Unconditional,\" but in most of the other songs on the album as well.\n\n\n\nDaydreamer by Molly Burch\n\n\n\nFor bonus points, checkout the video for \"Unconditional,\" which has a roller skating segment that I can't stop watching.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2023/12/A1FC96B3-3A38-4423-AF57-1.jpeg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2023-12-29T01:57:20.000Z","updated_at":"2023-12-31T03:09:42.000Z","published_at":"2023-12-30T00:00:23.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":"<style>\n.c-post-media { display: none; }\n</style>","codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"66b413767d0c0a178a2fe9ba","uuid":"e6f46ab8-b031-44fc-b38b-93fc7beee9ab","title":"Connection Vs.

On social media, many of the site’s key writers and editors, some of whom had been on staff for more than a decade, announced they’d been laid off. Much is still unknown about Pitchfork’s future, but music fans have reason to worry we’re losing the most important culture publication of the 21st century.\n\nPitchfork has had an outsized influence on the musical landscape over the years. That much is indisputable. Whether they has been a positive force is probably debatable. I remember a listening party with Josh Kolenik of Small Black a few months ago where he related that he stopped reading reviews of the band's work after a negative Pitchfork review. Scathing criticism from Pitchfork can have a chilling effect on album and concert ticket sales and affect a musician's livelihood. I'm not sure that they deserve a pass on their snobbery, especially when their dismissiveness is so impactful.\n\nErnie Smith from Tedium is effusive in his praise of the online publication.\n\nI would argue that Pitchfork, despite the criticism it has received, has often been great, but its efforts in the past few years to rethink its approach to music coverage have been welcome. I think a telling moment in Pitchfork’s history came on August 19, 2019. That was the day that the website, in a clear course correction from its past, did an appraisal of Taylor Swift’s first five albums, records that it would not have been caught dead reviewing a decade earlier. It was a statement of the kind of site Pitchfork needed to become—one that accepts that our influences come from the mainstream and the underground.\n\nIt's great that Pitchfork broadened their horizons. They needed more diversity. There is only so much we can read about bands with animals in their names or that sound like plumbing companies, and heaven knows Sufjan Stevens has had enough coverage to last him a lifetime. However, I'm not going to pretend like it's super brave to give Taylor Swift some attention. Sailing with the prevailing cultural headwinds doesn't take heroic effort.

The movie follows a woman named Jagna, whose promiscuity threatens the social fabric of her community in rural Poland around the turn of the last century. The use of the movie’s contemporary changes cast against the original book it was based upon (which was published in parts between 1904 and 1909) provides fertile ground for illustrating changes in society.\n\nSuch leanings—of the past towards communal responsibilities, and of the present towards individual rights—are no surprise. The discrepancy convinced me that the movie should be watched and the book read in tandem, to prevent us from imagining our moral “progress” over the past. We aren’t better than peasant communities which stigmatized rule-breakers: we just value mobility over accountability, and we have a different set of rules that makes heroes out of non-conformists and paints disruption as a virtue.\n\n[…]\n\nThe greatest danger is the invisible one, which is often the flipside of what garners all the attention. Our culture is obsessed with individual freedom and terrified of losing it. In our blind spot is the life of communal connectedness and relational obligation which has been disintegrating for centuries, and which cannot exist without limiting personal freedom.\n\nIn college, I wrote a paper for a history class on the controversy over the preaching of Anne Hutchinson that pitted her against the Puritan establishment in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Hutchinson had been a bold and effective preacher, but her leadership and attacks in the establishment threatened the unity of the fledgling colony, which relied on their faith traditions for group cohesion in a hostile and unfamiliar environment. The controversy made rivals out of Hutchinson and John Winthrop, the governor of the colony. Eventually, after a trial on various charges, Hutchinson was banished from Massachusetts Bay.\n\nWhile the earlier sources that I cited in the paper almost uniformly sympathized with Winthrop and the need for the community to be united, the later sources sided with Hutchinson and the dictates of her conscience. The shift in thinking paralleled a transformation in a culture that once placed primary importance on the thriving of society as a whole and one in which the individual is the focus.\n\nRuddell writes about just how far this shift has gone.\n\nThis idea has made us victims of its success. Our chief danger now is the opposite: normalcy is a reproach. To be a maverick, to be queer, to be your “true self,” to have your unique identity hallowed by society—this is the new normal. “Traditional” has become a slur, and rebellion (once a tool of justice) is cherished for its own sake.\n\nThe analogy of the early New England settlement is admittedly imperfect. Hutchinson was a committed Christian who was compelled by her conscience to preach, whereas the protagonist of The Peasants, Jagna, seems to be driven mostly by her own desires. However, I think the comparison is sufficient to draw out some introspection around the changes in our moral reasoning and what we owe to our communities versus our desires for personal autonomy and individual freedom.\n\nI don't have any easy answers here.

There isn't any attempt to denigrate other forms of Christian faith, but merely to point out that perhaps there is more out there to discover.\n\nI try to remember the words of Fr. Andrew, as I read the writings of Christians from other backgrounds. For instance, I frequently check out the Patheos site, which has a mix of Christian thinkers from different denominations, as well as writings from those of other religious traditions. The articles are helpfully broken up, with categories like, \"Progressive Christian,\" \"General Christian\" or \"Hindu.\" With these granular distinctions, you really know where the views are coming from!\n\nWhat I've noticed recently is that I see ads that are targeted towards the demographic of the reader expected to be reading that particular viewpoint. It has been revelatory. One particular ad stood out to me when I was on an evangelical Christian blog post. The ad featured a t-shirt that read, \"Wanna Make Everything Electric? Start With The Border Wall.\" I kind of did a double take when I saw that. I knew that some Christians were particularly vociferous in their opposition to illegal immigration and their support for a wall to stem the tide. When I saw that t-shirt, though, it struck me as especially callous. A flippant joke about electrocuting human beings like insects caught in a bug zapper is a seriously bad look.\n\nJack Jenkins writes for Religion News Service about a Catholic charity, that helps migrants, receiving harassment from far-right sources.\n\nFor Pajanor, whose group operates homeless shelters and 14 food pantries in the city, the recent avalanche of hate followed a visit by James O’Keefe, a far-right provocateur who was recently forced out of Project Veritas, the activist organization he founded, following complaints regarding his treatment of staff. O’Keefe appeared earlier this month with a film crew outside a hotel that was being used by Catholic Charities San Diego to house migrants who had been processed by CBP.\n\nIn videos posted to social media, O’Keefe and his team can be seen questioning security guards outside the hotel. O’Keefe even posed as an exterminator to try to gain entry. On multiple occasions, O’Keefe suggests migrants in the hotel came into the country illegally and speculates, without offering evidence, that some were being trafficked.\n\nThis kind of targeted abuse is a terrible phenomenon that was mostly ushered in by our former president and current Bible salesman, Donald J. Trump. As the article points out, the Catholic charity was serving legal immigrants who had been processed. They weren't even the Gonzaga basketball team. The tragic irony is that I saw the same ad hawking those crass t-shirts on the sidebar when reading the article about the harassment of the Catholic charity workers.\n\nAs many well known voices have pointed out, the Christian supporters of the former president have not, as supporters originally predicted, molded him in the image of Christ. Rather, he has molded them in the image of himself. Russell Moore points this out in his Christianity Today column.\n\n“If The Simpsons were written today and wished to make fun of evangelical Christians,” he writes, “would the caricature be someone inordinately devoted to his family, to prayer, to churchgoing, to kindness to his neighbors, to the awkward purity of his speech? Or would Ned Flanders be a screaming partisan, a violent insurrectionist, a woman-ogling misogynist, or an abusive pervert?”\n\nI follow the logic Dr. Moore is using and fully believe an evangelical caricature like Ned Flanders would look entirely different than they did 30 years ago. The worst realization is that, as Moore depicts, they would be quite the villain.","feature_image":"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/03/Border-wall.a4871059f94941458fbfdb5cd72a1cb9.jpg","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-03-29T19:38:12.000Z","updated_at":"2024-03-30T23:19:40.000Z","published_at":"2024-03-29T19:42:20.000Z","custom_excerpt":"The shifts in some of the most prominent Christian cultures in the U.S. have been disturbing.

John Morrison, writing about the short-lived group, notes that their sound, while not pop-punk as we think of it, nevertheless was both pop and punk. Particularly on their early 7” singles, they have a shambling, amateurish sound that is as winsome as it is lo-fi.
